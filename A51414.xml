            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT is much to be deſired there might be extant <hi>A Compleat Hiſtory of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Colonies of New-England,</hi> that God may have the praiſe of his goodneſs to his People here, and that the preſent and future Generations may have the benefit thereof. This being not attainable for the preſent, nor ſuddenly to be expected, it is very expedient, that (while ſundry of the Eldeſt Planters are yet living) <hi>Records</hi> and <hi>Memorials of Remarkable Providences</hi> be preſerved and publiſhed, that the true Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of theſe Plantations may not be loſt; that <hi>New-England,</hi> in all time to come, may remember the day of her ſmalleſt things; and that there may be a furniture of <hi>Materials</hi> for a true and full Hiſtory in after-times.</p>
            <p>For theſe and ſuch-like Reaſons we are willing to Recommend unto the Reader this preſent <hi>Narrative</hi> as a Uſeful Piece. The Author is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved godly man, and one of the firſt Planters at <hi>Plimouth;</hi> The Work it ſelf is Compiled with Modeſty of Spirit, Simplicity of Style, and Truth of Matter, containing the <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> for the ſpace of 47 years, with ſpecial reference to <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony, which was the firſt, and where the Author hath had his conſtant abode: And yet (ſo farre as his Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence did reach) relating many Remarkable Paſſages in the ſeveral Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; and alſo making an honourable mention of divers of the moſt Eminent Servants of God that have been amongſt us in ſeveral parts of the Country, after they had finiſhed their courſe. We hope that the Labor of this good man will finde a general Acceptance amongſt the People of God, and alſo be a means to provoke ſome or other in the reſt of the Colonies (who have had the knowledge of things from the beginning) to Contribute their <hi>Obſervations</hi> and <hi>Memorials</hi> alſo; by which means, what is wanting in this <hi>Narrative,</hi> may be ſupplied by ſome others: and ſo in the iſſue, from divers <hi>Memorials</hi> there may be matter for a juſt <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> in the Lords good time. In the mean time, this may ſtand for a <hi>Monument,</hi> and be deſervedly acknowledged as an <hi>Eben-Ezer,</hi> that <hi>Hitherto the Lord hath helped us.</hi>

            <p>THe conſideration of the weight of Duty that lieth upon us, to Commemorize to future Generations the memorable paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Gods Providence to us and our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors in the beginning of this Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath wrought in me a reſtleſneſs of ſpirit, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire, that ſomething might be atchieved in that behalf, more (or at leaſt otherwiſe) then as yet hath been done. Many diſcouragements I have met with, both from within and without my ſelf: but reflecting upon the <hi>Ends</hi> I have propoſed to my ſelf in ſetting out in this Work, it hath afforded me ſome ſupport, <hi>viz. The
<pb facs="tcp:96779:3"/>
glory of God, and the good of preſent and future Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Being alſo induced hereunto, by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that your ſelves (eſpecially ſome of you) are fully acquainted with many of the particulars, both concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> inſerted in the following Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and can on your own knowledge aſſert them for Truth. Were it ſo that any other had travelled in this kinde, in ſuch a way as might have conduced to a brief and ſatisfactory intelligence in particulars relating to the premiſes, I would have ſpared this labour, and have ſatisfied my ſelf in peruſal of their Works, rather then to have ſet pen to paper about the ſame; but having neither ſeen nor heard of any, eſpecially reſpecting this our Plantation of <hi>New-Plimouth,</hi> which God hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured to be the firſt in this Land, I have made bold to preſent your Worſhips with, and to publiſh to the world ſomething of the very <hi>firſt Beginnings</hi> of the great Actings of God in <hi>New-England,</hi> begun at <hi>New-Plimouth:</hi> wherein, the greateſt part of my intelligence hath been borrowed from my much honoured Uncle, Mr. <hi>William Bradford,</hi> and ſuch Manuſcripts as he left in his Study, from the year 1620, unto 1646; whom had God continued in this world ſome longer time, and given him reſt from his other more important Affairs, we might probably have had theſe things from an abler Pen, and better digeſted, then now you may expect. Certain <hi>Diurnals</hi> of the honoured Mr. <hi>Edward Winſlow,</hi> have alſo afforded me good light and help: and what from them both, and otherwiſe I have obtained, that I judged ſuitable for the following Diſcourſe, I have with care and faithfulneſs related; and have therein more
<pb facs="tcp:96779:3"/>
ſollicitouſly followed the truth of things (many of which I can alſo aſſert on my own knowledge) then I have ſtudied quaintneſs in expreſſions.</p>
            <p>I ſhould gladly have ſpoken more particularly of the Neighbouring <hi>United Colonies,</hi> whoſe ends and aims in their Tranſplanting of themſelves and Families, were the ſame with ours, viz. <hi>The glory of God, the propagation of the Goſpel, and enlargement of His Majeſties Dominions;</hi> but for want of intelligence, and that I may not prevent a better Pen, I ſhall onely make mention of ſome of their Worthies that we have been moſt acquainted with.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon the Clime nor Soyle of the Country, its Commodities or Diſcommodities; nor at large on the Natives, or their Cuſtomes and Manners: all which have been already declared by Captain <hi>Smith,</hi> Mr. <hi>Higginſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> and others. What it is, and what my aims at Gods glory, and my good affections to the place and people of whom I treat, may make it, I preſent your Worſhips with; Humbly craving your favourable aſpect, and good acceptance of my poor Endeavours; and that my ſelf and it may finde protection and ſhelter under the wings of your pious Patronage, to defend us againſt ſuch criticall and cenſorious eyes and tongues, as may either carp at my expreſsions, or miſconſtrue my intentions. The ample experience I have had of your undeſerved Favour and Reſpect to me, in my many years Service of the <hi>Publick,</hi> and my obſervation in that time, that you have deſired ſomething of this nature might be done, hath encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged me hereunto: your good acceptance whereof, ſhall ever oblige me to anſwerable returning of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb facs="tcp:96779:4"/>
and adminiſter to me further cauſe of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, That God hath given me an Habitation under your juſt and prudent Adminiſtrations; and wiſh for a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion of ſuch as may be skilfull to lead our <hi>Iſrael</hi> in this their peregrination; and when God ſhall take you hence, to receive the Crown of your labours and travels.

               <head>And firſt, of the beginning of the firſt Plantation in <hi>N.E.</hi> CALLED NEW-PLIMOUTH.</head>
               <p>IT is the uſuall manner of the Diſpenſation of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of Heaven, to work wonderfully by weak means for the effectuating of great things, to the intent that he may have the more Glory to himſelf: Many inſtances hereof might be produced, both out of the Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and common Experience; and amongſt many others of this kinde, the late Happy and Memorable Enterprize of the Planting of that part of <hi>America</hi> called <hi>New-England,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth to be Commemorized to future Poſterity.</p>
               <p>IN the Year 1602. divers godly Chriſtians of our Engliſh Nation in the North of <hi>England,</hi> being ſtudious of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and therefore not onely witneſſing againſt Humane Inventions, and Additions in the Worſhip of God, but minding moſt the poſitive and practical part of Divine Inſtitutions, they entred into Covenant, To walk with God, and one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in the enjoyment of the Ordinances of God, according
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96779:7"/>
to the Primitive Patern in the Word of God. But finding by experience they could not peaceably enjoy their own liberty in their Native Country, without offence to others that were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently minded; they took up thoughts of removing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Families into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they endeavoured to accompliſh, but met with great hinderance yet after ſome time, the good hand of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving obſtructions, they obtained their deſires arriving in <hi>Holland,</hi> they ſetled themſelves in the City of <hi>Leyden,</hi> in the year 1610, and there they continued divers years in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable condition, enjoying much ſweet ſociety and ſpiritual comfort in the wayes of God, living peaceably among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and being courteouſly entertained, and lovingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> amongſt whom they were ſtrangers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for their Paſtor Mr. <hi>John Robinſon,</hi> a man of a learned, poliſhed, and modeſt ſpirit, pious and ſtudious of the Truth, largely accompliſhed with ſutable Gifts and Qualifications to be a Shepherd over this Flock of Chriſt; having alſo a fellow-helper with him in the Elderſhip, Mr. <hi>William Brewſter,</hi> a man of approved Piety, Gravity, and Integrity, very eminently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with gifts ſutable to ſuch an Office.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding their amiable and comfortable carrying on, (as hath been ſaid) although the Church of Chriſt on Earth in holy Writ, is ſometimes called <hi>Heaven;</hi> yet there is alwayes in their moſt perfect ſtate here in this lower world, very much wanting as to abſolute and perfect happineſs, which is onely reſerved for the time and place of the full enjoyment of Celeſtial Glory: for, although this Church was at peace, and in reſt at this time, yet they took up thoughts of removing themſelves into <hi>America</hi> with common conſent; the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of removing thither being ſet on foot, and proſecuted by the Elders upon juſt and weighty grounds: for, although they did quietly and ſweetly enjoy their Church-liberties under the <hi>States,</hi> yet they foreſaw that <hi>Holland</hi> would be no place for their Church and Poſterity to continue in comfortably, at leaſt in that meaſure that they hoped to finde abroad; and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96779:7"/>
that for theſe Reaſon following, which I ſhall recite as received from themſelves.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe themſelves were of a different Language from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> where they lived, and were ſetled in their way, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that in ten years time, whiles their Church ſojourned amongſt them, they could not bring them to reform the neglect of Obſervation of the Lords-day as a Sabbath, or any other thing amiſs amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe their Countrymen, who came over to joyn with them, by reaſon of the hardneſs of the Country, ſoon ſpent their Eſtates, and were then forced either to return back to <hi>England,</hi> or to live very meanly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That many of their Children, through the extreme neceſſity that was upon them, although of the beſt diſpoſitions, and graciouſly inclined, and willing to bear part of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents burthens, were oftentimes ſo oppreſſed with their heavy labours, that although their Spirits were free and willing, yet their Bodies bowed under the weight of the ſame, and became decrepid in their early youth, and the vigour of Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in the very bud. And that which was very lamentable, and of all ſorrows moſt heavy to be born, was, that many by theſe occaſions, and the great licentiouſneſs of Youth in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the manifold temptations of the place, were drawn away by evil examples into extravagant and dangerous courſes, getting the reins on their necks, and departing from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: Some became Souldiers, others took upon them farre Voyages by Sea, and other-ſome worſe courſes tending to diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs, and the deſtruction of their Souls, to the great grief of their Parents, and the diſhonour of God; and that the place being a place of great licentiouſneſs and liberty to Children, they could not educate them, nor could they give them due correction without reproof or reproach from their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That their Poſterity would in few generations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Dutch,</hi> and ſo loſe their intereſt in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; they being deſirous rather to enlarge His Majeſties Dominions,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96779:8"/>
and to live under their Naturall PRINCE.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">This hath been graciouſly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſince, by moving the hearts of many of his Servants to be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in this work, with ſome good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, &amp; hopes of a further bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</note>Fifthly and laſtly, and which was not the leaſt, a great hope and inward Zeal they had of laying ſome good Foundation, or at leaſt to make ſome way thereunto, for the propagating and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Goſpel of the Kingdome of Chriſt in thoſe remote parts of the World, yea although they ſhould be but as ſtepping-ſtones unto others for the performance of ſo great a Work.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like were the true Reaſons of their removal, and not as ſome of their Adverſaries did upon the rumour thereof, caſt out ſlanders againſt them; as if the <hi>State</hi> was weary of them, and had rather driven them out, (as Heathen Hiſtories have feigned of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they went out of <hi>Egypt</hi>) then that it was their own free choice and motion.</p>
               <p>I will therefore mention a particular or two, to evince the contrary.</p>
               <p>And firſt, Although ſome of them were low in their Eſtates, yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> obſerving that they were diligent, faithful and careful of their engagements, had great reſpect to them, and ſtrove for their cuſtome.</p>
               <p>Again, ſecondly, the Magiſtrates of the City of <hi>Leyden</hi> where they lived, about the time of their coming away, in the publick place of Juſtice gave this commendable Teſtimony of them, in reproof of the <hi>Walloons</hi> who were of the <hi>French</hi> Church in the City; <hi>Theſe Engliſh</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>have lived now amongſt us Ten years, and yet we never had any Suit or Accuſation againſt them, or any of them; but your Strifes and Quarrels are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſons of their Removal above-named being debated firſt in private, and thought weighty, were afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in publick; and after ſolemn dayes of Humiliation obſerved both in publick and in private, it was agreed, That part of the Church ſhould go before their Brethren into <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> to prepare for the reſt: and if in caſe the major part of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96779:8"/>
the Church did chuſe to go over with the firſt, then the Paſtor to go along with them; but if the major part ſtayed, that he was then to ſtay with them.</p>
               <p>They having imployed ſundry Agents to treat with ſeveral Merchants in <hi>England,</hi> who adventured ſome conſiderable Sums in a way of valuation to ſuch as went perſonally on in the Voyage; the Articles of Agreement about the premiſes being fully concluded with the ſaid Merchants, and ſundry Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and Obſtructions removed, having alſo obtained <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents</hi> for the Northern parts of <hi>Virginia,</hi> of King <hi>James</hi> of Famous Memory; All things were got ready and provided, a ſmall Ship was bought and fitted out in <hi>Holland,</hi> of about ſixty Tun, called <hi>The Speedwell,</hi> as to ſerve to tranſport ſome of them over, ſo alſo to ſtay in the Country, and attend upon Fiſhing, and ſuch other affairs as might be for the good and benefit of the Colony when they came thither. Another Ship was hired at <hi>London,</hi> of Burthen about Nineſcore, called <hi>The May-flower,</hi> and all other things got in a readineſs: ſo being prepared to depart, they had a ſolemn day of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">The Text of Scripture was <hi>Ezra 8.21.</hi>
                  </note> the Paſtor teaching a part of the day very profitably and ſutably to the preſent occaſion, the reſt of the time was ſpent in pouring out of Prayers unto the Lord with great fervency, mixed with abundance of tears; and the time being come that they muſt depart, they were accompanied with moſt of their Brethren out of the City, unto a Town called <hi>Delfs Haven,</hi> where the Ship lay ready to receive them: ſo they left that goodly and pleaſant City, which had been their reſting place above eleven years; but they knew that they were <hi>Pilgrims and Strangers</hi> here below, and looked not much on theſe things,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.16.</note> but lifted up their eyes to Heaven, their deareſt Country, where <hi>God hath prepared for them a City,</hi> and therein quieted their ſpirits.</p>
               <p>When they came to the place, they found the Ship and all things ready; and ſuch of their Friends as could not come with them, followed after them, and ſundry came from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> to ſee them ſhipt, and to take their leaves, of them.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96779:9"/>
One night was ſpent with little ſleep with the moſt, but with friendly entertainment, and Chriſtian diſcourſe, and other reall expreſſions of true Chriſtian love. The next day the wind being fair they went on Board, and their friends with them, where truely-doleful was the ſight of that ſad and mournful parting, to hear what ſighs and ſobs and prayers did ſound amongſt them, what tears did guſh from every eye, and pithy ſpeeches pierced each others heart, that ſundry of the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſtrangers that ſtood on the Key as ſpectators, could not refrain from tears: yet comfortable and ſweet it was, to ſee ſuch lively and true expreſſions of dear and unfeigned love. But the Tide (which ſtayes for no man) calling them away, that were thus loth to depart, their Reverend Paſtor falling down on his knees, and they all with him, with watery cheeks commended them with moſt fervent Prayers unto the Lord and his bleſſing; and then with mutual imbraces, and many tears, they took their leaves one of another, which proved to be the <hi>laſt leave</hi> to many of them. Thus hoyſing Sail with a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous gale of wind, they came in ſhort time to <hi>Southampton,</hi> where they found the bigger Ship come from <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This was about the ſecond of <hi>July 1620.</hi>
                  </note> being ready with all the reſt of their Company, meeting each other with a joyful welcome and mutual congratulation.</p>
               <p>At their parting, their Paſtor Mr. <hi>John Robinſon</hi> wrote a Letter to the whole Company, which I thought meet here to inſert, being ſo fruitfull in it ſelf, and ſutable to their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

Make account of me in the mean time as a man divided in my ſelf, with great pain, (and as Natural bonds ſet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96779:9"/>
aſide) having my better part with you: And although I doubt not but in your godly wiſdomes you both foreſee and reſolve upon that which concerneth your preſent ſtate and condition, both ſeverally and joyntly; yet have I thought it but my duty to adde ſome further ſpur of provocation unto them who run already, if not becauſe you need it, yet becauſe I owe it in love and duty. And firſt, as we are daily to renew our Repentance with our God, eſpecially for our ſins known, and generally for our unknown treſpaſſes: ſo doth the Lord call us in a ſingular manner, upon occaſions of ſuch difficulty and danger as lieth upon you, to a both narrow ſearch, and careful reformation of your wayes in his ſight, leſt he calling to remembrance our ſins forgotten by us, or unrepented of, take advantage againſt us, and in judgement leave us to be ſwallowed up in one danger or other: whereas on the contrary, ſin being taken away by earneſt Repentance, and the pardon thereof from the Lord ſealed up to a mant Conſcience by his Spirit, great ſhall be his ſecurity and peace in all dangers, ſweet his comforts in all diſtreſſes, with happy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from all evil, whether in life or death. Now next after this heavenly peace with God and our own Conſciences, we are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to provide for peace with all men, what in us lyeth, eſpecially with our Aſſociates; and for that, watchfulneſs muſt be had that we neither at all in our ſelves do give, no nor eaſily take offence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given by others. <hi>Woe be to the world for offences,</hi> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be neceſſary, conſidering the malice of Satan and mans corruption, <hi>that offences come,</hi> yet <hi>woe unto the man,</hi> or woman either, <hi>by whom the offence cometh,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth. 18.7.</hi> and if offences in the unſeaſonable uſe of things in themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, be more to be feared then death it ſelf, as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>1 Cor. 9.15.</hi> how much more in things ſimply evil, in which neither honour of God nor love of man is thought worthy to be regarded? Neither yet is it ſufficient that we keep our ſelves by the grace of God from giving of offence, except withall we be armed againſt the taking of them when they are given by others: for how imperfect and lame is the work of Grace in that perſon, who wants Charity <hi>to cover a multitude of offences?</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks. Neither are you to be wherred to this grace,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96779:10"/>
onely upon the common grounds of Chriſtianity, which are, that perſons ready to take offence, either want Charity to cover offences, or Wiſdome duely to weigh humane frailties; or laſtly, are groſs though cloſe Hypocrites, as Chriſt our Lord teacheth, <hi>Mat. 7.1, 2, 3.</hi> as indeed, in my own experience few or none have been found which ſooner give offence, then ſuch as eaſily take it; neither have they ever proved ſound and profitable Members in Societies, who have nouriſhed this <hi>touchy humour.</hi> But beſides theſe, there are divers Motives provoking you above others to great care and conſcience this way; as firſt, there are many of you ſtrangers as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo to the infirmities one of another, and ſo ſtand in need of more watchfulneſs this way, leſt when ſuch things fall out in men and women as you expected not, you be inordinately affected with them, which doth require at your hands much Wiſdome and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the covering and preventing of incident offences that way. And laſtly, your intended courſe of Civil Community, will miniſter continuall occaſion of offence, and will be as fewel for that fire, except you diligently quench it with <hi>brotherly forbearance:</hi> and if taking of offence cauſleſly or eaſily at mens doings, be ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be avoided; how much more heed is to be taken that we take not offence at God himſelf? which yet we certainly do, ſo oft as we do murmure at his Providence in our croſſes, or bear impatiently ſuch afflictions as wherewith he is pleaſed to viſit us. Store up therefore Patience againſt the evil day; without which, we take offence at the Lord himſelf in his holy and juſt works. A fourth thing there is carefully to be provided for; <hi>viz.</hi> That with your common Imployments, you joyn conmon Affections truely bent upon the generall Good, avoiding as a deadly. Plague of your both Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Special Comforts, all retiredneſs of minde for proper ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and all ſingularly affected every manner of way, let every man repreſs in himſelf, and the whole Body in each perſon, as ſo many Rebels againſt the Common Good, all <hi>private reſpects of mens ſelves,</hi> not ſorting with the general Convenience. And as men are careful not to have a new Houſe ſhaken with any violence, before it be well ſetled, and the parts firmly knit: ſo be you, I beſeech you Brethren, much more carefull that the Houſe of God
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96779:10"/>
(which you are, and are to be) be not ſhaken with unneceſſary No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, or other Oppoſitions at the firſt ſetling thereof.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Whereas you are to become a Body Politick, uſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt your ſelves Civil Government, and are not furniſhed with perſons of ſpecial Eminency above the reſt, to be choſen by you into Office of Government; Let your wiſdome and godlineſs appear not onely in chooſing ſuch perſons as do intirely love, and will promote the Common Good; but alſo in yielding unto them all due Honour and Obedience in their lawful Adminiſtrations, not beholding in them the ordinarineſs of their perſons, but Gods Ordinance for your good: not being like the fooliſh multitude, who more honour the gay Coat, then either the virtuous minde of the man, or the glorious Ordinance of the Lord: But you know better things, and that the Image of the Lords Power and Authority which the Magiſtrate beareth is honourable, in how mean perſons ſoever; and this duty you may the more willingly, and ought the more conſcionably to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, becauſe you are (at leaſt for the preſent) to have them for your ordinary Governours, which your ſelves ſhall make choice of for that Work.</p>
                     <p>Sundry other things of Importance I could put you in minde of, and of thoſe before-mentioned in more words; but I will not ſo far wrong your godly mindes, as to think you heedleſs of theſe things, there being alſo divers amongſt you ſo well able both to admoniſh themſelves and others of what concerneth them.

               <head>Of the Troubles that befell the firſt Planters upon the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> and in their Voyage in coming over into <hi>New England,</hi> and their arrival at <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> aliàs <hi>Cape James.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ALl things being got ready, and every buſineſs diſpatched, they ordered and diſtributed their Company for either Ship, (as they conceived for the beſt) and choſe a Governour, and two or three Aſſiſtants for each Ship, to order the people by the way, and to ſee to the diſpoſing of the Proviſion, and ſuch like affairs; all which was not only with the liking of the Maſters of the Ships, but according to their deſires: which being done, they ſet Sail from <hi>Southampton</hi> the fifth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1620. But alas, the beſt Enterprizes meet oftentimes with many diſcouragements; for they had not ſailed farre, before Mr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> the Maſter of the leſſer Ship, complained that he found his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſo leak, as he durſt not put further to Sea: on which they were forced to put in at <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> the Maſter of the biggeſt Ship likewiſe putting in there with him; and the ſaid leſſer Ship was ſearched, and mended, and judged ſufficient for the Voyage by the Workmen that mended her: On which, both the ſaid Ships put to Sea the ſecond time, but they had not ſailed above an hundred Leagues, ere the ſaid <hi>Reynolds</hi> again complained of his Ship being ſo leak, as that he feared he ſhould founder in the Sea, if he held on; and then both Ships bore up again, and went in at <hi>Plimouth:</hi> but being there ſearched again, no great matter appeared, but it was judged to be the general weakneſs of the Ship. But the true reaſon of the retarding and delaying of matters was not as yet diſcerned: the one of them reſpecting the Ship (as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was found) was, that ſhe was over-Maſted, which when ſhe came to her trim in that reſpect, ſhe did well, and made divers profitable and ſucceſsful Voyages. But ſecondly, and more eſpecially, by the deceit of the Maſter and his Company,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96779:11"/>
who were hired to ſtay a whole year in the Country; but now fancying diſlike, and fearing want of Victuals, they plotted this ſtratagem to free themſelves, as afterwards was known, and by ſome of them confeſſed; for they apprehended that the greater Ship being of force, and in whom moſt of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were beſtowed, that ſhe would retain enough for her ſelf, whatſoever became of them and the Paſſengers: But ſo ſtrong was ſelf-love and deceit in this man, as he forgot all duty and former kindneſs, and dealt thus falſly with them. Theſe things thus falling out, it was reſolved by the whole to diſmiſs the leſſer Ship, and part of the Company with her, and that the other part of the Company ſhould proceed in the bigger Ship: which when they had ordered matters in reference thereunto, they made another ſad parting, the one Ship, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the leſſer going back for <hi>London,</hi> and the other <hi>(viz.) The May-flower,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> being Maſter, proceeding on in the intended Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>Theſe troubles being blown over, and now all being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact together in one Ship, they put to Sea again with a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wind: but after they had enjoyed fair winds for a ſeaſon, they met with many contrary winds and fierce ſtorms, with which their Ship was ſhrewdly ſhaken, and her upper works made very leaky, and one of the main Beams of the Mid-ſhips was bowed and cracked, which put them to ſome fear that ſhe would not be able to perform the Voyage; on which the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of the Seamen and Paſſengers had ſerious conſultation what to do, whether to return or hold on: but the Ship proving ſtrong under water, by a Screw the ſaid Beam was brought into his place again; which being done, and well ſecured by the Carpenter, they reſolved to hold their Voyage, and ſo after many boiſterous ſtorms in which they could bear no ſail, but were forced to lye at Hull many dayes together; after long beating at Sea, they fell in with the land called<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> ſo called at the firſt by Captaia <hi>Goſnold</hi> and his Company, <hi>Anno 1602,</hi> becauſe they took much of that Fiſh there; and afterward called <hi>Cape James</hi> by Captain <hi>Smith.</hi> The Point of the Cape is called <hi>Point Care,</hi> and <hi>Tuckers Terrour;</hi> and by the French and Dutch <hi>Mallacar,</hi> by reaſon of the perillous Sholes.</note> 
                  <hi>Cape Cod:</hi> the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96779:12"/>
which being made, and certainly known to be it, they were not a little joyful. After ſome little deliberation had amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Maſter of the Ship, they tacked about to ſtand to the Southward, to finde ſome place about <hi>Hudſons River,</hi> (according to their firſt intentions) for their Habitations: But they had not ſailed that Courſe above half a day, but they fell amongſt perillous Sholes and Breakers, and they were ſo farre intangled therewith, as they conceived themſelves in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and the wind ſhrinking upon them withall, they reſolved to bear up again for the Cape aforeſaid: the next day, by Gods Providence, they got into the Cape harbour. Thus they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> aliàs <hi>Cape James,</hi> in <hi>November</hi> 1620. and being brought ſafe to land, they fell upon their knees and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the God of Heaven, who had brought them over the vaſt and furious Ocean, and delivered them from many perils and miſeries.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, it is to be obſerved, that their putting into this place was partly by reaſon of a ſtorm, by which they were forced in, but more eſpecially by the fraudulency and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of this Plot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Dutch and Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> I have had late and certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence.</note> the Maſter of the Ship: for, their Intention, as is before-noted, and his Engagement, was to <hi>Hudſons River;</hi> but ſome of the <hi>Dutch</hi> having notice of their intentions, and having thoughts about the ſame time of erecting a Plantation there likewiſe, they fraudulently hired the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> by delayes while they were in <hi>England,</hi> and now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of the danger of the Sholes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to diſappoint them in their going thither: But God out-ſhoots Satan often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in his own Bow; for had they gone to <hi>Hudſons River</hi> as before expreſſed, it had proved very dangerous to them: for although it is a place farre more commodious, and the Soil more fertile, yet then abounding with a multitude of pernicious Salvages, whereby they would have been in great peril of their lives, and ſo the work of tranſplanting the Goſpel into theſe parts, much endangered to have been hindred and retarded: but God ſo diſpoſed, that the place where they afterward ſetled was much depopulated by a great Mortality amongſt the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96779:12"/>
which fell out about two years before their arrival, whereby he made way for the carrying on of his good purpoſe in promulgating of his Goſpel as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>But before we paſs on, let the Reader with me make a pauſe, and ſeriouſly conſider this poor peoples preſent condition, the more to be raiſed up to admiration of Gods goodneſs towards them in their preſervation: for being now paſſed the vaſt Ocean, and a ſea of Troubles before in their Preparation, they had now no Friends to welcome them, no Inns to entertain or refreſh them, no Houſes, or much leſs Towns to repair unto to ſeek for ſuccour: the <hi>Barbarians</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle fell amongſt in his Shipwrack at the Iſle <hi>Melita,</hi>

                  <hi>ſhewed him no ſmall kindneſs;</hi> but theſe Salvage <hi>Barbarians</hi> when they met with them (as after will appear) were readier to fill their ſides full of Arrows, then otherwiſe: and for the ſeaſon, it was Winter, and they that know the Winters of the Country, know them to be ſharp and violent, ſubject to cruel and fierce Storms, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to travel to known places, much more to ſearch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Coaſts. Beſides, what could they ſee but a hideous and deſolate Wilderneſs, full of wilde Beaſts and wilde Men? and what multitudes of them there were, they then knew not: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they as it were go up to the Top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> to view from this Wilderneſs a more goodly Country to feed their hopes; for which way ſoever they turned their eyes (ſave up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Heaven) they could have little ſolace or content in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any outward object, for Summer being ended, all things ſtand in appearance with a weather-beaten face, and the whole Country full of Woods and Thickets, repreſented a wilde and ſalvage hew; if they looked behinde them, there was the mighty Ocean which they had paſſed, and was now as a main Bar and Gulph to ſeparate them from all the Civil Parts of the World. The Maſter of the Ship and his Company preſſing with ſpeed to look out a place for their Settlement at ſome near diſtance, for the ſeaſon was ſuch as he would not ſtir from thence, untill a ſafe Harbour was diſcovered by them with their Boat: yea, it was ſometimes threatned, that if they would not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96779:13"/>
get a place in time, that they and their goods ſhould be turned on ſhore, and that the Ship would leave them; the Maſter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing himſelf, that Proviſions ſpent apace, and that he would keep ſufficient for himſelf and his Company for their return. It is true indeed, that the love and affections of their Brethren they left behinde them in <hi>Holland,</hi> was cordial and intire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, but they had little power to help them or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: what could now ſuſtain them but the Spirit of God and his grace?

               <p>After this, their Shallop being ready, they ſet out the ſecond time for a more full Diſcovery of this place, eſpecially a place that ſeemed to be an opening as they went into the ſaid Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſome two or three Leagues off, which the Maſter judged to be a River; about thirty of them went out on this ſecond Diſcovery, the Maſter of the Ship going with them: but upon the more exact diſcovery thereof, they found it to be no Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for Ships, but onely for Boats. There they alſo found two of their Houſes covered with Mats, and ſundry of their Implements in them; but the people ran away, and could not be ſeen: Alſo there they found more of their Corn and Beams of various colours; the Corn and Beams they brought away,<note place="margin">About <hi>6</hi> months after they gave them full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to their content.</note> purpoſing to give them full ſatisfaction when they ſhould meet with any of them. And here is to be noted, a ſpecial and a great mercy to this people, that here they got them ſeed to plant them Corn the next year, or otherwiſe they might have ſtarved, for they had none, nor any likelyhood to get any,<note place="margin">A ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God to be noted.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the ſeaſon had been paſt (as the ſequel did manifeſt) neither is it likely that they had had this, if the firſt Diſcovery had not been made, for the ground was now all covered with Snow, and hard frozen; but the Lord is never wanting unto thoſe that are his in their greateſt needs. Let his holy Name have all the praiſe.</p>
               <p>Having thus diſcovered this place, it was controverted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them what to do, touching their abode and ſetling there. Some thought it beſt for many Reaſons to abide there:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe of the Convenience of the Harbour for Boats, though not for Ships.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was good Corn-ground ready to their hands, as was ſeen by experience in the goodly Corn it yielded, which would again agree with the ground, and be natural ſeed for the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:96779:15"/>3. Cape <hi>Cod</hi> was like to be a place for good Fiſhing, for they ſaw daily great Whales of the beſt kinde for Oyl.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The place was likely to be healthful, ſecure, and defenſible.</p>
               <p n="5">5. and laſtly, The eſpecial Reaſon was, that now the heart of Winter and unſeaſonable weather was come upon them, ſo as they could not go upon Coaſting and Diſcovery, without danger of loſing both men and Boat, upon which would follow the overthrow of all, eſpecially conſidering what variable winds and ſudden ſtorms do there ariſe; alſo cold and wet lodging had ſo tainted their people, as ſcarce any of them were free from vehement Coughs, as if they ſhould continue long, it would indanger the lives of many, and breed diſeaſes &amp; infection amongſt them. Again, that as yet they had ſome Proviſions, but they would quickly be ſpent, and then they ſhould have nothing to comfort them in their labour and toyl that they were like to undergo. At the firſt it was alſo conceived, whiles they had competent Victuals that the Ship would ſtay, but when that grew low, they would be gone, and let them ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Others again urged to go to <hi>Agawam,</hi> alias <hi>Angawam,</hi> a place about twenty Leagues off to the Northward, which they had heard to be an excellent Harbour for Ships, better ground, and better fiſhing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for any thing they knew there might be hard by us a farre better Seat,<note place="margin">About this time Mrs. <hi>Suſanna White</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of a Son who was named <hi>Peregrine;</hi> he was the firſt of the Engliſh that was born in <hi>N.

                  </note> and it would be a great hinderance to ſeat where they ſhould remove again.</p>
               <p>But to omit many Reaſons and Replies concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was in the end concluded to make ſome diſcovery within the Bay, but in no caſe ſo farre as <hi>Angawam.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Robert Coppin</hi> their Pilot made relation of a great Navigable River, and good Harbour in the other Head-land of the Bay, almoſt right over againſt Cape <hi>Cod,</hi> being in a right line not much above eight Leagues diſtant, in which he had once been; and beyond that place they that were to go on diſcovery were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned not to go.</p>
               <p>The Month of <hi>November</hi> being ſpent on theſe Affairs, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96779:15"/>
having much foul weather; on the ſixth of <hi>December</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to ſend out their Shallop again on a third Diſcovery. The Names of thoſe that went on this Diſcovery, were Mr. <hi>John Carver,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Bradford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edward Winſlow,</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain <hi>Miles Standiſh,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Howland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Warren,</hi> Mr. <hi>Steven Hopkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edward Tilly,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Tilly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> Mr. <hi>Coppin, John Allerton, Thomas Engliſh, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Doten,</hi> with the Maſter Gunner of the Ship, and three other of the common Seamen; theſe ſet ſail on Wedneſday the ſixth of <hi>December</hi> 1620, intending to Circulate the deep Bay of Cape <hi>Cod,</hi> the weather being very cold, ſo as the Spra of the Sea lighting on their Coats, they were as if they had been glazed; notwithſtanding, that night they got down into the bottom of the Bay, and as they drew near the ſhore they ſaw ſome ten or twelve <hi>Indians,</hi> and landed about a League off them, (but with ſome difficulty, by reaſon of the Sholes in that place) where they tarried that night. In the morning they divided their Company to coaſt along, ſome on ſhore, and ſome in the Boat, where they ſaw the <hi>Indians</hi> had been the day before cutting up of a Fiſh like a <hi>Grampus;</hi> and ſo they ranged up and down all that day, but found no people, nor any place they liked as fit for their ſettlement: and that night they on ſhore met with their Boat at a certain Creek,<note place="margin">This is thought to be a place called <hi>Namske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.</hi>
                  </note> where they made them a Barricado of boughs and logs for their lodging that night, and being weary betook themſelves to their reſt. The next morning about five of the clock (ſeeking guidance and protection from God by prayer) and refreſhing themſelves in way of preparation to perſiſt on in their intended Expedition, ſome of them carried their Arms down to the Boat, having laid them up in their Coats from the moiſture of the weather; but others ſaid they would not carry theirs untill they went themſelves: But preſently all on a ſudden, about the dawning of the day, they heard a great and ſtrange cry, and one of their Company being on board, came haſtily in, and cried, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, Indians,</hi> and withall their Arrows came flying amongſt them; on which, all their men ran with ſpeed to recover their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96779:16"/>
Arms (as by Gods good Providence they did.) In the mean time, ſome of thoſe that were ready diſcharged two Muskets at them, and two more ſtood ready at the entrance of their Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz, but were commanded not to ſhoot, untill they could take full aim at them; and the other two charged again with all ſpeed, for there were onely four that had Arms there, and defended the Barricado which was firſt aſſaulted. The cry of the <hi>Indians</hi> was dreadful, eſpecially when they ſaw their men run out of their Rendezvouz towards the Shallop to recover their Arms; the <hi>Indians</hi> wheeling about upon them: but ſome running out with Coats of Mail, and Cuttle-axes in their hands, they ſoon recovered their Arms, and diſcharged amongſt them, and ſoon ſtayed their violence. Notwithſtanding, there was a luſty man, and no leſs valiant, ſtood behinde a Tree within half a Musket ſhot, and let fly his Arrows amongſt them: he was ſeen to ſhoot three Arrows, which were all avoided, and ſtood three ſhot of a Musket, untill one taking full aim at him, made the Bark or Splinters of the Tree fly about his ears;<note place="margin">This place on this occaſion was called, <hi>the firſt Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                  </note> after which he gave an extraordinary ſhriek, and away they went all of them: and ſo leaving ſome to keep the Shallop, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them about a quarter of a mile, that they might conceive that they were not afraid of them, or any way diſcouraged.</p>
               <p>Thus it pleaſed God to vanquiſh their Enemies, and to give them deliverance, and by his ſpecial Providence ſo to diſpoſe, that not any one of them was either hurt or hit, though their Arrows came cloſe by them; and ſundry of their Coats which hung up in the Barricado were ſhot through and through: for which ſalvation and deliverance they rendred ſolemn Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>From hence they departed, and coaſted all along, but diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no place likely for Harbour, and therefore haſted to the place their Pilot (as aforeſaid) told them of, who aſſured them that there was a good Harbour, and they might fetch it before night: of which they were glad, for it began to be foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>After ſome hours ſailing it began to Snow and Rain, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96779:16"/>
about the middle of the Afternoon the wind increaſed, and the Sea became very rough, and they brake their Rudder, and it was as much as two men could do to ſteer the Boat with a couple of Oars; but the Pilot bid them be of good chear, for he ſaw the Harbour: but the ſtorm increaſing, and night drawing on, they bare what ſail they could to get in while they could ſee: but herewith they brake their Maſt in three pieces, and their Sail fell over-board in a very grown Sea, ſo as they had like to have been caſt away; yet by Gods mercy they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered themſelves, and having the flood with them, ſtruck into the Harbour. But when it came to, the Pilot was deceived in the place, and ſaid, <hi>Lord be merciful to us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the place called <hi>the Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets Noſe</hi> and <hi>Sagaquab,</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Plimouth</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> 
                  <hi>my eyes never ſaw this place before:</hi> and he and the Maſters Mate would have run the Boat aſhore in a Cove full of Breakers before the wind, but a luſty Seaman which ſteered bade them that rowed, <hi>If they were men, about with her, elſe they were all caſt away;</hi> the which they did with all ſpeed: ſo he bade them <hi>be of good chear, and row hard, for there was a fair Sound before them, and he doubted not but they ſhould finde one place or other where they might ride in ſafety.</hi> And although it was very dark, and rained ſore, yet in the end they got under the lee of a ſmall Iſland,<note place="margin">This was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called <hi>Clarks Iſland,</hi> becauſe Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Mate firſt ſtepped on ſhore thereon.</note> and remained there all night in ſafety. But they knew not this to be an Iſland untill the next morning, but were divided in their mindes, ſome would keep the Boat, doubting they might be amongſt the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> others were ſo wet and cold they could not endure, but got on ſhore, and with much difficulty got fire, and ſo the whole were refreſhed, and reſted in ſafety that night. The next day rendring thanks to God for his great deliverance of them, and his continued merciful good Providence towards them, and finding this to be an Iſland, it being the laſt day of the week, they reſolved to keep the Sabbath there.</p>
               <p>On the ſecond day of the week following they ſounded the Harbour, and found it fit for Shipping, and marched into the Land, and found divers Corn fields, and little running Brooks, a place (as they ſuppoſed) fit for Situation, at leaſt it was the beſt that they could finde, and the ſeaſon and their preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96779:17"/>
made them glad to accept of it. So they returned again to their Ship with this News to the reſt of their people, which did much comfort their hearts.</p>
               <p>On the fifteenth of <hi>December</hi> they weighed Anchor, to go to the place they had diſcovered, and arrived the ſixteenth day in the Harbour they had formerly diſcovered, and afterward took better view of the place, and reſolved where to pitch their Dwellings; and on the Five and twentieth day of <hi>December</hi> began to erect the firſt Houſe for common uſe, to receive them and their goods: and after they had provided a place for their goods and common ſtore (which was long in unlading for want of Boats, and by reaſon of foulneſs of the winter wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſickneſs of divers) they began to build ſome ſmall Cottages for Habitation, as time would admit; and alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted of Laws and Orders both for their <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Military Government,</hi> as the neceſſity of their preſent condition did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. But that which was ſad and lamentable, that in two or three Moneths time half of their Company died, eſpecially in <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> being the depth of Winter, wanting houſes and other comforts, being infected with the Scurvy, and other Diſeaſes, which this long Voyage and their incommodate condition had brought upon them, ſo as there died ſometimes two, ſometimes three on a day in the aforeſaid time, that of One hundred and odde perſons, ſcarce Fifty remained. Amongſt others in the time fore-named, died Mr. <hi>William Mullins,</hi> a man pious and well-deſerving, endowed alſo with a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able outward Eſtate; and had it been the will of God that he had ſurvived, might have proved an uſeful Inſtrument in his place, with ſeveral others who deceaſed in this great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affliction, whom I might take notice of to the like effect. Of thoſe that did ſurvive in this time of diſtreſs and calamity that was upon them, there was ſometimes but ſix or ſeven ſound perſons, who (to their great commendation be it ſpoken) ſpared no pains night nor day to be helpful to the reſt, not ſhunning to do very mean ſervices to help the weak and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. In which Sickneſs the Seamen ſhared alſo deeply, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96779:17"/>
many died, to about the one half of them before they went away. Thus being but few, and very weak, this was an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for the Salvages to have made a prey of them, who were wont to be the moſt cruel and treacherous people in all theſe parts, even like Lions; but to them they were as Lambs, God ſtriking a dread in their hearts, ſo as they received no harm from them. The Lord alſo ſo diſpoſed, as aforeſaid, much to waſte them by a great Mortality, together with which were their own Civil Diſſentions, and Bloody Wars, ſo as the twentieth perſon was ſcarce left alive when theſe people arrived, there remaining ſad ſpectacles of that Mortality in the place where they ſeated, by many bones and skulls of the dead lying above-ground; whereby it appeared, that the living of them were not able to bury their dead. Some of the ancient <hi>Indians</hi> that are ſurviving at the writing hereof, do affirm, That about ſome two or three years before the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> here arrived, they ſaw a <hi>Blazing Star</hi> or <hi>Comet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This ſeemeth to be the ſame that was ſeen about that time in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </note> which was a fore-runner of this ſad Mortality, for ſoon after it came upon them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. Thus God made way for his people, by removing the Heathen, and planting them in the Land; yet we hope in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ſome of the poſterity of theſe poor blinde Salvages, by being means (at leaſt ſtepping-ſtones) for others to come and Preach the Goſpel amongſt them: of which afterwards in its more proper place. But to return.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> after their arrival would ſhew themſelves afarre off, but when they endeavoured to come near them, they would run away. But about the ſixteenth of <hi>March,</hi> 1621. a certain <hi>Indian</hi> called <hi>Samòſet</hi> came boldly amongſt them, and ſpake to them in broken Engliſh, which yet they could well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; at which they marvelled: but at length they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that he belonged to the Eaſtern parts of the Country, and had acquaintance with ſundry of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fiſhermen, and could name ſundry of them, from whom he learned his language. He became very profitable to them, in acquainting them with many things concerning the ſtate of the Country in the Eaſtern parts, as alſo of the people here; of their Names,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96779:18"/>
Number, and Strength, of their Situation, and Diſtance from this place, and who was Chief amongſt them: He told them alſo of another <hi>Indian</hi> called <hi>Squanto,</hi> alias <hi>Siſquantam,</hi> one of this place, who had been in <hi>England,</hi> and could ſpeak better Engliſh then himſelf: And after courteous entertainment of him, he was diſmiſſed. Afterwards he came again, with ſome other Natives, and told them of the coming of the great <hi>Sachem</hi> named <hi>Maſſaſoiet,</hi> who (about four or five dayes after) came with the chief of his Friends and other Attendants, with the aforeſaid <hi>Squanto,</hi> with whom (after friendly entertainment and ſome gifts given him) they made a League of Peace with him, which continued with him and his Succeſſors to the time of the writing hereof.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96779:19"/>
had not his Man reſcued him with a Sword, and ſo they got away, and made ſhift to get into <hi>Virginia,</hi> where he died, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his wounds, or the Diſeaſes of the Country, or both, is uncertain. By all which it may appear how farre this people were from Peace, and with what danger this Plantation was begun, ſave as the powerful hand of the Lord did protect them.</p>
               <p>Theſe things were partly the Reaſons why the <hi>Indians</hi> kept aloof, as aforeſaid, and that it was ſo long ere they could come to ſpeech with any of them: Another Reaſon (as afterwards themſelves made known) was, how that about three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe firſt Planters arrived, a certain <hi>French</hi> Ship was caſt away at <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> but the men got on ſhore, and ſaved their lives, and much of their Victuals and other goods; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Indians</hi> heard of it, and gathered together from theſe parts, and never left watching and dogging them, untill they got advantage, and kill'd them all but three or four, which they kept and ſent from one <hi>Sachem</hi> to another to make ſport with them, and uſed them worſe then Slaves; and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Ship was now come to revenge it. Two of the ſaid <hi>French</hi> ſo uſed were redeemed by the aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Dermer,</hi> the other died amongſt the <hi>Indians:</hi> and as the <hi>Indians</hi> have reported, one of them lived amongſt them untill he was able to diſcourſe with them, and told them, <hi>That God was angry with them for their wickedneſs, and would deſtroy them, and give their Country to another people, that ſhould not live like beaſts as they did, but ſhould be clothed, &amp;c.</hi> But they derided him, and ſaid, <hi>That they were ſo many that God could not kill them.</hi> His anſwer was, <hi>That though they were never ſo many, God had many wayes to deſtroy them that they knew not.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A memorable paſſage of Gods puniſhing of the Heathen for their notorious Blaſphemy, and other ſins.</note> Shortly after his death came the Plague, a Diſeaſe they never heard of before, and mightily ſwept them away, and left them as dung upon the earth (as you have heard.) Not long after came the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to <hi>New-Plimouth,</hi> and then ſeveral of the <hi>Indians</hi> began to minde the <hi>French-mans</hi> words, thinking him to be more then an ordinary man.

                  <head>Now followeth ſeveral Paſſages of the Providence of God to, and the further progreſs of the firſt Planters at <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> appertaining to the Year <hi>1621.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THey now began to haſten the Ship away, which tartied ſo long by reaſon of the neceſſity and danger that lay on them, becauſe ſo many died both of themſelves, and the Ships Company likewiſe; by which they became ſo few, as the Maſter durſt not put out to Sea, untill thoſe that lived recovered of their Sickneſs, and the Winter over.</p>
                  <p>The Spring of this year they Planted their firſt Corn in <hi>New-England,</hi> being inſtructed in the manner thereof by the fore-named <hi>Squanto:</hi> they likewiſe ſowed ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Grain with little ſucceſs, by reaſon partly of the badneſs of the Seed, and lateneſs of the ſeaſon, or ſome other defect not then diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>In the Month of <hi>April</hi> in this year, their Governour Mr. <hi>John Carver</hi> fell ſick, and within a few dayes after died, whoſe death was much lamented, and cauſed great heavineſs amongſt them; and there was indeed great cauſe. He was buried in the beſt manner they could, with as much Solemnity as they were in a capacity to perform, with the Diſcharge of ſome Volleys of ſhot of all that bare Arms. This worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was one of ſingular Piety, and rare for Humility, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by his great condeſcendency, when as this poor miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble people were in great ſickneſs and weakneſs, he ſhunned not to do very mean ſervices for them, yea the meaneſt of them: He bare a ſhare likewiſe of their labour in his own perſon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as their extreme neceſſity required; who being one alſo of a conſiderable Eſtate, ſpent the main part of it in this Enterprize, and from firſt to laſt approved himſelf not onely as their Agent in the firſt tranſacting of things, but alſo all along to the period of his life, to be a pious, faithful, and very benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Inſtrument, and now is reaping the fruit of his labour with the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:96779:21"/>His Wife who was alſo a gracious woman, lived not ſix weeks after him: ſhee being overcome with exceſſive grief for the loſs of ſo gracious an Husband, likewiſe died.</p>
                  <p>In ſome ſhort diſtance of time after this, Mr. <hi>William Bradford</hi> was choſen Governour of <hi>Plimouth</hi> in his ſtead, being not as yet well recovered of his weakneſs, having bin at the point of death, and Mr. <hi>Iſaac Allerton</hi> likewiſe was choſen to be his Aſſiſtant.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond of <hi>July</hi> in this year they ſent Mr. <hi>Edward Winſlow</hi> and Mr. <hi>Steven Hopkins,</hi> unto the great Sachem <hi>Maſſaſoiet</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, with a gratuitie to congratulate with him, and to view his Country, and likewiſe to take notice of what ſtrength of men he had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> having <hi>Squanto</hi> for their guide: who found his place to be about forty Miles from <hi>New-Plimouth,</hi> his People few in compariſon of what they had been, by reaſon of the mortality amongſt the <hi>Indians</hi> forementioned. Theſe brought word upon their return of the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> a People that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on the otherſide of that great Bay, which are a People ſtrong and many in number, living compact together, and had not at all been touched with the waſting Plague before ſpecified. They alſo brought a full intelligence in reference unto the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars they were ſent about, and ſo returned in ſafety.</p>
                  <p>Thus their peace being well eſtabliſhed with the <hi>Natives</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, which was much furthered by an <hi>Indian</hi> named <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bamak,</hi> who came to live amongſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> he being a proper luſty young man, and one that was in account amongſt the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> in thoſe parts for his valour, continued faithful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> until his death. He with the ſaid <hi>Squanto</hi> being ſent amongſt the <hi>Indians</hi> about buſineſs for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> were ſurprized by an <hi>Indian Sachem</hi> named <hi>Corbitant,</hi> who was no friend to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> he met with them at <hi>Namaſſaket,</hi> and began to quarrel with them, and offered to ſtab <hi>Hobamak,</hi> who being a ſtrong man, ſoon cleared himſelf of him; and with ſpeed came and gave intelligence to the Governour of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> ſaying, <hi>he feared that</hi> Squanto <hi>was ſlain,</hi> for they were both threatned, and for no other cauſe, but that they were friends to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſerviceable to them. On which it was thought
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96779:22"/>
meet to vindicate their Meſſengers, and not to ſuffer them to be thus wronged, and it was concluded to ſend ſome men to <hi>Namaſſaket</hi> well armed, and to fall upon them: whereupon fourteen men being well prepared were ſent, under the conduct of Captain <hi>Miles Standiſh,</hi> who when they came thither beſet the houſe, and the ſaid Captain entred into the ſame to look for the ſaid <hi>Corbitant,</hi> but he was fled, and ſo they miſſed of him; but underſtood that <hi>Squanto</hi> was alive; ſo they withheld, and did no hurt, ſave three of the <hi>Natives</hi> preſſing out of the houſe when it was beſet, were ſorely wounded; which they brought home to their Town with them, and were dreſſed by their Chirurgion, and cured.</p>
                  <p>After this they had many Congratulations from divers <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chems,</hi> and much firmer peace, yea thoſe of the Iſle of <hi>Capewak</hi> ſent to make friendſhip with them, and this <hi>Corbitant</hi> himſelf uſed the mediation of <hi>Maſſaſoiet</hi> to make his peace, but was ſhie to come near them a long time after.</p>
                  <p>After this, on the eighteenth of <hi>September</hi> they ſent out their Boat to the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> with ten men, and <hi>Squanto</hi> for their Interpreter, to diſcover and view that Bay, and to trade with the <hi>Natives;</hi> and found kinde entertainment with them, who expreſſed themſelves to be much afraid of the <hi>Tarateens,</hi> a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Eaſtern part of <hi>New-England,</hi> which uſed to come in Harveſt time and take away their corn, and many times kill ſome of their people; who after they had accompliſhed their buſineſs, returned in ſafety, and made report of the place, wiſhing they had been there ſeated. But the Lord who aſſigns to all men the bounds of their habitations, had appointed it for another end and uſe.</p>
                  <p>And thus they found the Lord to be with them in all their wayes, and to bleſs their out-goings and in-comings: for which let his holy Name have the praiſe for ever.</p>
                  <p>Being now well recovered in reſpect of health (as hath been ſaid) they began to fit up their buildings againſt winter, and received in their firſt harveſt, and had great plenty of fowl and fiſh, to their great refreſhing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:96779:22"/>About the ninth of <hi>November</hi> came in a ſmall ſhip to them unexpected, in which came Mr. <hi>Robert Cuſhman,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">This ſhip was called <hi>the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> in which came no Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which was one cauſe of a great famine that befell the Plantation of <hi>New Plimouth</hi> ſoon after.</note> who was both a godly man and an active and faithful agent, and uſeful inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the common intereſt of this firſt deſign; and there came with him in that ſhip, thirty five perſons, to remain and live in the Plantation: which did not a little rejoyce the firſt planters. And theſe when they came on ſhore, and found all well, and ſaw plenty of proviſions beyond their expectation, were alſo ſatisfied and no leſs glad: for coming in at <hi>Cape Cod</hi> before they came to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and ſeeing nothing there but a barren place; they then began to think what ſhould become of them, if the People were dead or cut off by the <hi>Indians;</hi> and began to conſult upon ſome paſſages, which ſome of the Seamen had caſt out, to take the Sails from the Yard, leſt the ſhip ſhould get away and leave them: but the Maſter hearing thereof, gave them good words, and told them, <hi>If any thing but well ſhould have befallen the People at</hi> Plimouth, <hi>he hoped he had proviſions enough to carry them to</hi> Virginia, <hi>and whiles he had any, they ſhould have their part,</hi> which gave them good ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>This ſhip ſtayed at <hi>Plimouth</hi> not above fourteen dayes, and returned, and ſoon after her departure, the People called the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> aforeſaid, ſent a meſſenger unto the Plantation, with a bundle of Arrows, tyed together with a Snakes skin, which their Interpreter <hi>Squanto</hi> told them was a threatning and a challenge; upon which the Governour of <hi>Plimouth</hi> ſent them a rough anſwer, <hi>(viz.) That if they loved war rather then peace, they might begin when they would, they had done them no wrong, neither did they fear them, or ſhould they finde them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided:</hi> and by another Meſſenger ſent the Snakes skin back again with Bullets in it, but they would not receive it, but ſent it back again. It is probable the reaſon of this their Meſſage to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was their own ambition, who ſince the death of ſo many <hi>Indians,</hi> thought to domineer and lord it over the reſt, and conceived the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would be a barre in their way, and ſaw that <hi>Maſſaſoiet</hi> took ſhelter already under their wings; but this made the <hi>Engliſh</hi> more carefully to look to themſelves,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96779:23"/>
ſo as they agreed to cloſe their Dwellings with a good ſtrong Pale, and made Flankers in convenient places, with Gates to ſhut, which were every night locked, and a Watch kept, and when need required there was alſo Warding in the day time; and the Company was by the Governour and Captains advice, divided into four Squadrons, and every one had their quarter appointed them, unto which they were to repair: and if there ſhould be any cry of <hi>Fire,</hi> a Company was appointed for a Guard with Muskets, whiles others quenched the Fire, the ſame to prevent <hi>Indian</hi> Treachery. And herewith I ſhall end the Paſſages of this Year.</p>

               <p>AT the Spring of this Year (the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having certified the <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> that they would come again unto them) they accordingly prepared to go thither; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome rumours which they heard from <hi>Hobamak,</hi> their friend fore-named, who feared that the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> were joyned with the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> and might betray them if they were not careful; and intimated alſo his jealouſies of <hi>Squanto,</hi> by what he gathered from ſome private whiſperings between him and other <hi>Indians,</hi> that he was not really cordial to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in what he pretended, made them cautelous. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ſent out their Boat with ten of their principal men about the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and both <hi>Squanto</hi> and <hi>Hobamak</hi> with them, in regard of the jealouſie between them: but they had not been gone long, ere that an <hi>Indian</hi> belonging to <hi>Squanto</hi>'s family came running, ſeeming to be in great fear, and told them that many of the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> with <hi>Corbitant,</hi> (and he thought <hi>Maſſaſoiet</hi>) was coming againſt them: At which they betook them to their Arms, and ſuppoſing that the Boat was not as yet out of call, they cauſed a Piece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be diſcharged, to call them in again: But this proved

otherwiſe, for no <hi>Indians</hi> came. After this they went to the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> and had good Trade, and returned in ſafety, God be praiſed.</p>
               <p>But by the former paſſages and things of like nature, they began to ſee that <hi>Squanto</hi> ſought his own ends, and played his own game, by putting the <hi>Indians</hi> in fear, and drawing gifts from them to inrich himſelf; making them believe he could ſtir up war againſt them when he would, and make peace for them when he would; yea he made them believe, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> kept the Plague buried in the ground;<note place="margin">This was ſaid to be a barrel of Gun-powder buried in the ground.</note> and could ſend it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom they would, which did much terrifie the <hi>Indians;</hi> and made them more depend on him, and ſeek more to him then to their great Sachem <hi>Maſſaſoiet;</hi> which procured him envy, and had like to have coſt him his life: for after the diſcovery of theſe practiſes, the ſaid <hi>Maſſaſoiet</hi> ſought it both privately and openly; which cauſed him to ſtick cloſe to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and never after durſt go from them until his death. They alſo made good uſe of the emulation that grew between <hi>Hobamak</hi> and him, which made them both carry more ſquarely; and the Governour ſeemed to countenance the one, and their Captain the other; by which they had the better intelligence, and it made them both the more diligent.</p>
               <p>About the latter end of <hi>May</hi> they eſpied a veſſel at ſea, which at the firſt they thought to be a <hi>French-man,</hi> but it proved one that belonged to Mr. <hi>Thomas Weſton</hi> a Merchant; which came from a ſhip which he and another had ſent out on fiſhing to a place called <hi>Damarels Cove,</hi> in the Eaſtern parts of <hi>N. E.</hi> this boat brought ſeven men, and ſome letters, but no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to them, of which they were in continual expectation from <hi>England,</hi> which expectations were fruſtrated in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, for they never had any ſupply to any purpoſe after this time, but what the Lord helped them to raiſe by their induſtry amongſt themſelves: for all that came afterwards was too ſhort for the paſſengers that came with it.</p>
               <p>After this the ſame year; the above-named Mr. <hi>Thomas Weſton,</hi> who had formerly been one of the Merchant-adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers

                  </note> in the one of them came ſixty luſty men, who were to be put on ſhore at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> for the ſhip was to go with other paſſengers to <hi>Virginia;</hi> theſe were courteouſly entertained (with the ſeven men fore-named belonging to the ſaid <hi>Weſton,</hi> at <hi>Plimouth</hi> aforeſaid) until the ſhip returned from <hi>Virginia,</hi> which was the moſt part of that Summer; many of them being ſick, and all of them deſtitute of habitation, and unacquainted with this new beginning: at the ſhips return from <hi>Virginia,</hi> by the direction of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Weſton</hi> their Maſter, or ſuch as he had ſet over them, they removed into the <hi>Maſſachuſets Bay,</hi> he having got a Pattent for ſome part there, yet they left all their ſick folk at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> until they were ſetled and fitted for houſing to receive them: Theſe were an unruly company, and had no good government over them, and by diſorder fell into many wants, as afterwards will appear.</p>
               <p>But before I paſs on, I may not omit the mentioning of a courteous Letter that came in the veſſel above-named, in which the above-ſaid ſeven men came, being directed to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> with reſpect unto the whole <hi>Plantation,</hi> from a Captain of a ſhip at the Eaſtward, who came thither on a fiſhing voyage; the which for the ingenuity of the man, and his courteſie therein expreſſed, may not unfitly be here inſerted, being inſcribed as followeth.</p>

               <p>This Summer they built a Fort with good Timber, both ſtrong and comely, which was of good defence, made with a flat Roof, and Battlements, on which Fort their Ordnance were mounted, and where they kept conſtant Watch, eſpecially in time of danger: It ſerved them alſo for a Metting-houſe, and was fitted accordingly for that uſe. It was a great Work for them to do in their weakneſs, and times of want; but the danger of the time required it, there being continual rumours of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and fears of their riſing againſt them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Narrhaganſets;</hi> and alſo the hearing of that great and ſad Maſſacre in <hi>Virginia</hi> above-named.</p>
               <p>It may not here be omitted, that notwithſtanding all their great pains and induſtry, and the great hopes they had of a large Crop, the Lord ſeemed to threaten them with more and ſorer Famine by a great Drought, which continued from the third week in <hi>May,</hi> untill the middle of <hi>July,</hi> without any Rain, and with great heat of Weather for the moſt part, inſomuch as their Corn began to wither away, although it was planted

with Fiſh, according to their uſual manner in thoſe times; yet at length it began to languiſh fore, and ſome of the dryer grounds was parched like withered Hay, part whereof was never recovered. Upon which they ſet a part a ſolemn Day of Humiliation, to ſeek the Lord by humble and ſervent Prayer in this great diſtreſs: and he was pleaſed to give them a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſpeedy anſwer, both to their own and the <hi>Indians</hi> admiration that lived amongſt them; for all the morning, and greateſt part of the day, it was clear weather, and very hot, and not a Cloud nor any ſign of Rain to be ſeen, yet towards evening it began to overcaſt, and ſhortly after to Rain, with ſuch ſweet and gentle ſhowers, as gave them cauſe of rejoycing and bleſſing God: it came without either Wind or Thunder, or any violence, and by degrees in that abundance, as that the Earth was throughly wet, and ſoaked therewith, which did ſo apparently revive and quicken the decayed Corn and other Fruits, as was wonderful, and made the <hi>Indians</hi> aſtoniſhed to behold. A little before the Lord ſent this Rain of Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon his people, one of them having occaſion to go to the houſe of the afore-named <hi>Hobamak</hi> the <hi>Indian,</hi> he the ſaid <hi>Hobamak</hi> ſaith unto him,<note place="margin">The perſon that made this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtill ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving, and a principal man in the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Newr Plimouth.</hi>

                  <hi>I am much troubled for the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>for I am afraid they will loſe all their Corn by the Drought, and ſo they will be all ſtarved; as for the</hi> Indians; <hi>they can ſhift better then the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>for they can get Fiſh to help themſelves.</hi> But afterwards the ſame man having occaſion to go again to his houſe, he ſaid to him, <hi>Now I ſee that the</hi> Engliſh mans <hi>God is a good God, for he hath heard you, and ſent you Rain, and that without Storms, and Tempeſts, and Thunder, which uſually we have with our Rain, which breaks down our Corn; but your ſtands whole and good ſtill; ſurely your God is a good God:</hi> or with words to the life effect.</p>
               <p>And after this gracious return of Prayers in this ſo ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a bleſſing of the Rain, the Lord ſent them ſuch ſeaſonable ſhowers, with interchange of warm weather, as (through his bleſſing) cauſed in its time a fruitful and liberal Harveſt, to their great Comfort and Rejoycing: for which Mercy, in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96779:25"/>
time convenient, they alſo ſolemnized a Day of Thankſgiving unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now the welcome Harveſt approached, in the which all had ſome refreſhment, but it aroſe but to a little in compariſon of a whole years ſupply; partly by reaſon they were not yet well acquainted with the manner of the Husbandry of the <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, (having no other) and alſo their many other Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but chiefly their weakneſs for want of food, ſo as to appearance Famine was like to enſue, if not ſome way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: Markets there was none to go unto, but onely the <hi>Indians;</hi> but they had no Trading ſtuff.<note place="margin">Another good providence of God tending to their relief.</note> But behold now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Providence of God; A Ship came into the Harbour, one Captain <hi>Jones</hi> being chief in her, ſet out by ſome Merchants to diſcover all the Harbours between <hi>Cape Cod</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> and to Trade along the Coaſt.

               <p>MR. <hi>Weſtons</hi> people fore-named, notwithſtanding all helps they could procure for ſupply of Proviſions, fell into great Extremity, which was occaſioned by their exceſſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence while they had it, or could get it; and after they came into want, many ſold away their Clothes and Bed-coverings; others were ſo baſe as they became ſervants to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and would cut them Wood, and fetch them Water for a Cap full of Corn; others fell to ſtealing both night and day from the <hi>Indians,</hi> of which they grievouſly complained. In the end they came to that miſery, that ſome ſtarved and died with hunger; and one in gathering of Shell-fiſh was ſo weak, as he ſtuck faſt in the mud, and was found dead in the place; and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96779:27"/>
moſt of them left their Dwellings, and were ſcattered up and down in the Woods by the Water-ſide, where they could finde Ground-nuts and Clams, here ſix, and there ten, by which their carriages they became contemned and ſcorned of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> inſomuch as they began greatly to inſult over them in a moſt inſolent manner, ſo as if they had ſet on ſuch Victuals as they had gotten to dreſs it, when it was ready the <hi>Indians</hi> would come and eat it up: and when Night came, when as poſſibly ſome of them had a ſorry Blanket, or ſuch like, to lap themſelves in, the <hi>Indians</hi> would take it, and let the other lye all night in the cold, ſo as their condition was very lamentable; and in the end they were fain to hang one of their Company, whom they could not reclaim from ſtealing, to give the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> content.</p>
               <p>Whiles things went on in this manner with them, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and People of <hi>Plimouth</hi> had notice that the Sachem <hi>Maſſaſoiet</hi> their Friend was ſick, and near unto death, and they ſent to viſit him, and ſent him ſome comfortable things, which gave him content, and was a means of his recovery: Upon which occaſion he diſcovered the Conſpiracy of theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> how they were reſolved to cut off Mr. <hi>Weſtons</hi> Company, for the continual Injuries they had done them, and would now take opportunity of their weakneſs, and do it; and for that end had conſpired with other <hi>Indians</hi> their Neighbours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts: and thinking the People here would revenge their death, they therefore thought to do the like by them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent it, and that ſpeedily, by taking ſome of the chief of them before it was too late, for he aſſured them of the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>This did much trouble them, and they took it into ſerious conſideration, and found upon Examination, and other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences to give light thereinto, That the matter was really ſo as the ſaid <hi>Sachrin</hi> had told them. In the mean time came an<note n="*" place="margin">This mans name was <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nchas Pratt,</hi> who hath penned the particular of his perillous Journey, and ſom other things relating to this Tragedy.</note> 
                  <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> from the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> from the ſaid Company in miſery, as hath been above-related; with a ſmall pack at his back; and although he knew not a foot of the way, yet he

got ſafe hither, but loſt his way, which was well for him, for he was purſued by two <hi>Indians,</hi> who by Gods Providence miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of him by that means; and he related how all things ſtood with them there, and that he durſt ſtay no longer, for he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by what he obſerved they would be all ſlain ere long. This made them make the more haſte, and they diſpatched a Boat away with ſome men under the conduct of Captain <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh,</hi> who found them in a miſerable condition; out of which he reſcued them, and helped them to ſome relief, cut off ſome of the chief Conſpirators againſt them, and according to his Order offered to bring them all to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to be there untill Mr. <hi>Weſton</hi> came, or ſome other way ſhould be preſented for their help: they thanked him and the reſt, but they rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that he would help them with ſome Corn, and they would go with their ſmall Ship to the Eaſtward, to look out for a way for themſelves, either to have relief by meeting with Mr. <hi>Weſton,</hi> or if not to work with the Fiſhermen for their ſupply, and their paſſage for <hi>England:</hi> ſo they ſhipped what they had of any worth, and he helped them with as much Corn as he could, and ſaw them out of the Bay under ſail, and ſo came home, not taking the worth of a peny of any of them.</p>
               <p>This was the end of theſe that ſometimes boaſted of their ſtrength, being all able, luſty men, and what they would do and bring to paſs, in compariſon of the people at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> who had many Women and Children, and weak ones; and ſaid at their firſt arrival, when they ſaw the wants at <hi>Plimouth,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Shortly after Mr. <hi>Weſton</hi> came over with ſome of the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, where he heard of the Ruine of his Plantation, and got a Boat, and with a man or two came to ſee how things were; but by the way (for want of skill) in a Storm he caſt away his Boat in the bottome of the Bay, between <hi>Merrimack</hi> and

                  <hi>Paſcataqua,</hi> and hardly eſcaped with life; and afterwards fell into the hands of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who pillaged him of all that he had ſaved from the Sea, and ſtripped him of all his Clothes to his Shirt. At laſt he got to <hi>Paſcataqua,</hi> and borrowed a Suit of Clothes, and got means and came to <hi>Plimouth.</hi> A ſtrange alteration there was in him, to ſuch as had ſeen and known him in his former flouriſhing condition; ſo uncertain are all things of this uncertain world.</p>
               <p>But to return to the ſtate and condition of the Planters at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> all this while no ſupply heard of, ſo they began to think how they might raiſe as much corn as they could, ſo as they might not languiſh in miſery as formerly they had done, and at the preſent they did, and it was thought the beſt way, and accordingly given way unto, that every one ſhould plant Corn for his own particular, and in that regard provide for themſelves, and in other reſpects continue the general courſe and way as before: &amp; ſo they ranged all their youth under ſome family, and ſet upon ſuch a courſe, which had good ſucceſs, for it made all hands very induſtrious, ſo as much Corn was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>This courſe being ſetled, by that time all their Corn was planted, all their victuals was ſpent, and they were only to reſt on Gods providence; many times at night, not knowing where to have any thing to ſuſtain nature the next day, and ſo (as one well obſerved) had need to pray that God would give them their daily bread, above all people in the world; yet they bare thoſe wants with great patience and alacrity of ſpirit, and that for ſo long a time as the moſt part of two years.</p>

               <p>They having one boat left, and ſhee none of the beſt, with a net which they bought, improved them for the taking of Baſſe, which proved a good help to them, and when thoſe failed they were fain all hands to go dig ſhell-fiſh out of the ſands for their living; in the winter ſeaſon ground-nuts and fowl was the principal of their refreſhing, until God ſent more ſetled and ſuitable ſupplies, by his bleſſing upon their induſtry.</p>
               <p>At length they received ſome letters from the adventurers, which gave them intelligence of a ſhip ſet out, to come hither unto <hi>Plimouth,</hi> named the <hi>Parragon;</hi> This ſhip was bought by Mr. <hi>John Pierce,</hi> and ſet out on his own charge, upon hopes of great matters; the paſſengers and goods, the Company ſent in her he took in for fraight, for which they agreed with him to be delivered here: this was he in whoſe name their firſt Patent was taken, for this place where <hi>Plimouth</hi> is, by reaſon of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and ſome allyance that ſome of their friends had with him, but his name was only uſed in truſt; but when he ſaw they were here hopefully ſeated, and by the ſucceſs God gave them, had obtained the favour of the Council of <hi>New-England,</hi> he goes &amp; ſues to the ſaid Council for another Patent of much larger extent in their names, which was eaſily obtained, but he meant to keep it to himſelf, and to allow them what he pleaſed to hold of him as tenants, and ſue to his Courts as chief Lord: but the Lord marvelouſly croſſed him in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96779:29"/>
for when his ſhip above-named ſet out from the <hi>Thames,</hi> ſhe ſprang a leak by that time ſhe got to the <hi>Downs,</hi> and alſo by reaſon of a chop that accidentally befel one of her Cables, it brake in a ſtreſs of wind while ſhe there rode, and was in danger to have bin driven on the ſands, and thereupon was conſtrained to return back to <hi>London,</hi> and there arrived in fourteen dayes after, and was haled up into the Dock, and an hundred pound more beſtowed on her to mend her leaks and bruiſes, which ſhe received in the aforeſaid ſtorm; and when ſhe was again fitted for the voyage, he peſtered his ſhip, and takes in more paſſengers, and thoſe ſome of them not very good, to help to bear his loſſes, and ſets out the ſecond time; and when he was half way or thereabouts to <hi>New-England</hi> was forced back again by an extreme tempeſt, wherein the goodneſs and mercy of God appeared in their preſervation, being one hundred and nine ſouls. This ſhip ſuffered the greateſt extremity at ſea, at her ſecond ſetting forth, as is ſeldome the like heard of; It was about the middle of <hi>February</hi> that the ſtorm began, and it continued for the moſt part of fourteen dayes, but for two or three dayes and nights together in moſt violent extremity: at the beginning of the ſtorm, their boat being above-decks, was thrown over-board; they ſpent their Main-maſt, their Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe was beaten off with the ſtorm,<note place="margin">This Relation was made by Mr <hi>William Pierce</hi> the Maſter of the ſaid ſhip, and ſome of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of good credit.</note> and all the upper works of their ſhip: he that ſtood to give direction, for the guiding of her before the ſea, was made faſt, to prevent his waſhing over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and the ſeas did ſo over-rake them, as that many times thoſe upon the deck, knew not whether they were within-board or without; and by her extreme leaking, being a very rotten ſhip, and the ſtorm increaſing, ſhe was once very near founder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſea, ſo as they thought ſhe would never riſe again: Notwithſtanding the Lord was pleaſed of his great mercy to preſerve them; and after great weather-beating and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary danger, they arrived ſafe at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> to the wonderment of all that beheld in what condition they were, and heard what they had endured.</p>
               <p>Upon the return of the ſaid Mr. <hi>John Pierce</hi> for <hi>England;</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:96779:29"/>
(he being perſonally in this his ſhip in the ſo ſad ſtorm) the other Merchant Adventurers, got him to aſſign over the grand-Patent to the Company, which he had taken in his own Name, and made quite void their former Patent.</p>
               <p>About the latter end of <hi>June,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This was the ſhip called the <hi>Paragon</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</note> came in a ſhip at <hi>Plimouth</hi> with Captain <hi>Francis Weſt,</hi> who had a Commiſſion to be Admiral of <hi>New-England,</hi> to reſtrain Interlopers, and ſuch fiſhing ſhips as came to fiſh and trade without licence from the Council of <hi>New-England,</hi> for which they ſhould pay a great ſum of money; but he could do no good of them, for they were too ſtrong for him, and he found the fiſhermen to be refractory, and their owners upon complaint made to the Parliament, procured an order, that fiſhing ſhould be free. He told the Governour of <hi>Plimouth</hi> that they ſpake with a ſhip at ſea, and were on board her, that was coming to the ſaid Plantation of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> in which were ſundry paſſengers, and they marvelled ſhe was not arrived, fearing ſome miſcarriage; for they loſt her in a ſtorm that fell ſhortly after they had been on board: which relation filled them full of fears, yet mixed with hope. The Maſter of this ſhip had two Hogſheads of Peaſe to ſell, but ſeeing their wants, held them at Nine pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> an Hogſhead, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Eight he would not take, and yet would have Beaver at an under-rate; but they told him <hi>they had lived ſo long without, and would do ſtill, rather then give ſo unreaſonably:</hi> ſo the ſaid Ship went from <hi>Plimouth</hi> to <hi>Virginia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About fourteen dayes after came in the Ship called <hi>The Ann,</hi> whereof Mr. <hi>William Pierce</hi> was Maſter: two of the principal Paſſengers that came in this Ship were Mr. <hi>Timothy Hatherly</hi> and Mr. <hi>George Morton;</hi> the former, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Timothy Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly,</hi> ſoon after his arrival met with ſome croſs Providences by the burning of his Houſe, whereby he was much impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and much diſcouraged, and returned the Winter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing for <hi>England:</hi> and afterwards the Lord was pleaſed to renew his Eſtate, and he came again into <hi>New-England,</hi> and proved a very profitable and beneficial Inſtrument both in Church and Common-wealth, being one of the firſt beginners,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96779:30"/>
and a good Inſtrument to uphold the Church and Town of <hi>Situate;</hi> and alſo ſerved God and the Juriſdiction of <hi>Plimouth</hi> in the place of Magiſtracy, and retained his Integrity in the Profeſſion of the wayes of Chriſt unto old Age; ſtill ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving at the penning hereof.</p>
               <p>The latter of the two fore-named, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>George Morton,</hi> was a pious gracious Servant of God, and very faithful in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever publick Imployment he was betruſted withall, and an unfeigned well-willer, &amp; according to his Sphere and Condition, a ſutable Promoter of the Common Good and Growth of the Plantation of <hi>New-Plimouth,</hi> labouring to ſtill the Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents that ſometimes would ariſe amongſt ſome ſpirits, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Difficulties of theſe new beginnings: but it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to put a period to his dayes ſoon after his arrival in <hi>New-England,</hi> not ſurviving a full year after his coming aſhore. With much comfort and peace he fell aſleep in the Lord in the Month of <hi>June, Anno</hi> 1624.</p>
               <p>About ten dayes after the arrival of the Ship called <hi>The Ann</hi> above-named, there came in another ſmall Ship of about forty four Tun, named the <hi>James,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bridges</hi> being Maſter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which ſaid Ship, the <hi>Ann</hi> had loſt at Sea by reaſon of foul Weather: ſhe was a fine new Veſſel, built to ſtay in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. One of the principal Paſſengers that came in her was Mr. <hi>John Jenny,</hi> who was a godly, though otherwiſe a plain man, yet ſingular for publickneſs of ſpirit, ſetting himſelf to ſeek and promote the Common Good of the Plantation of <hi>New-Plimouth;</hi> who ſpent not onely his part of this Ship (being part Owner thereof) in the general Concernment of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but alſo afterwards was alwayes a Leading-man in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the general Intereſt of this Colony: He lived many years in <hi>New-England,</hi> and fell aſleep in the Lord <hi>Anno</hi> 1644. In the two Ships laſt named, came over many other perſons beſides thoſe before recited, who proved of good uſe in their places.</p>
               <p>Theſe Paſſengers, ſeeing the low and poor condition of thoſe that were here before them, were much daunted and diſmayed,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96779:30"/>
and according to their diverſe humours, were diverſly affected. Some wiſhed themſelves in <hi>England</hi> again; others fell on weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fancying their own miſery in what they ſaw in others; other-ſome pitying the diſtreſs they ſaw their Friends had been long in, and ſtill were under. In a word, all were full of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; onely ſome of their old Friends rejoyced to ſee them, and that it was no worſe with them, for they could not expect it ſhould be better, and now hoped they ſhould enjoy better dayes together. And truely it was no marvel they ſhould be thus affected, for they were in a very low condition, both in reſpect of Food and Clothing at that time.</p>
               <p>To conſider ſeriouſly how ſadly the Scripture ſpeaks of the Famine in <hi>Jacobs</hi> time, when he ſaid to his Sons, <hi>Go, buy us food, that we may live and not die;</hi> and that <hi>the Famine was great and heavy in the Land,</hi> and yet they had great Herds, and ſtore of Cattel of ſundry kindes, which beſides their fleſh, muſt needs produce other uſeful benefits for food, and yet it was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſore affliction: But the miſery of the Planters at <hi>Plimouth</hi> at the firſt beginning, muſt needs be very great therefore, who not onely wanted the <hi>ſtaff of Bread,</hi> but all the benefits of Cattel, and had no <hi>Egypt</hi> to go to, but God fed them out of the Sea for the moſt part; ſo wonderful is his powerful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over his in all Ages: <hi>for his Mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the middle of <hi>September</hi> arrived Captain <hi>Robert Gorges</hi> in the Bay of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> with ſundry Paſſengers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, intended there to begin a Plantation, and pitched upon that place which Mr. <hi>Weſton</hi> fore-named had forſaken. He had a Commiſſion from the Council of <hi>New-England</hi> to be Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Governour of the Country: and they appointed for his Council and Aſſiſtants, Captain <hi>Francis Weſt</hi> the aforeſaid Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, <hi>Chriſtopher Levet</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and the Governour of <hi>Plimouth</hi> for the time being: Alſo they gave him Authority to Chooſe ſuch other as he ſhould finde fit. Alſo they gave by their Commiſſion <hi>full Power to him and his Aſſiſtants, or any three of them, (whereof himſelf was alwayes to be one) To do and execute
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96779:31"/>
what to them ſhould ſeem good, in all Caſes, Capital, Criminal, and Civil;</hi> with divers other Inſtructions: Of which, and his Commiſſion, it pleaſed him to ſuffer the Governour of <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> to take a Copy.</p>
               <p>He meeting with the aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Weſton</hi> at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> called him before him and ſome other of the Aſſiſtants, with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Plimouth</hi> aforeſaid, and charged him with <hi>the ill carriage of his Men at the</hi> Maſſachuſets, <hi>by which means the peace of the Country was diſturbed, and himſelf and the people which he had brought over to plant in that Bay, thereby much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced.</hi> To which the ſaid <hi>Weſton</hi> eaſily anſwered, <hi>That what was done in that behalf, was done in his abſence, and might have befallen any man: He left them ſufficiently provided, and conceived they would have been well governed; and for any errour committed, he had ſufficiently ſmarted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſaid Mr. <hi>Tho: Weſton</hi> was a man of parts, and a Merchant of good account in <hi>London.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after theſe paſſages he went for <hi>England,</hi> and died in the City of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> he proved but a ſtaff of Reed to the Plantation of <hi>Plimouth.</hi>
                  </note>Another particular was, <hi>An abuſe done to his father Sir</hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando Gorges, <hi>and to the State.</hi> The thing was this: He uſed him and others of the Council of <hi>New-England,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him a Licenſe for the Tranſporting of many great Pieces of Ordnance for <hi>New-England,</hi> pretending great Fortification here in the Country; for which when he had obtained, he ſold them beyond Sea for his private profit: At which the State was much offended, and his Father ſuffered a ſhrewd check, and he had Order to apprehend him.</p>
               <p>The ſaid <hi>Weſton</hi> excuſed it as well as he could, but could not wholly deny it: but after much ſpeech about it, by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Governour of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and ſome other Friends, the ſaid Captain <hi>Gorges</hi> was inclined to gentleneſs, (though he apprehended the abuſe of his Father deeply) which when the ſaid <hi>Weſton</hi> perceived, he grew the more preſumptuous, and gave ſuch cutting and provoking ſpeeches, as made the ſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain riſe up in great indignation and diſtemper, vowing, <hi>That he would either curb him, or ſend him home for</hi> England: At which the ſaid <hi>Weſton</hi> was daunted, and came privately to the Governour of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to know <hi>whether they would ſuffer him to ſend him for</hi> England? It was anſwered him, <hi>They could not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96779:31"/>
hinder it:</hi> and much blamed him, that after they had pacified things, he ſhould thus break out by his own folly and raſhneſs, and bring trouble upon himſelf and others. He confeſt <hi>it was his paſſion,</hi> and prayed the Governour aforeſaid <hi>to intreat for him, and procure a pacification for him, if he could:</hi> the which at laſt he did obtain with much difficulty. So he was called again, and the ſaid Captain <hi>Gorges</hi> was content to take his own Bond to be ready to to make further anſwer, when either he or the Lords of the Council ſhould ſend for him; and at laſt he took onely his own Word, and ſo there was a friendly part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on all hands.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, the ſaid Captain <hi>Gorges</hi> took his leave, and went to the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> by land, being very thankful for his kinde Entertainment. His Ship ſtayed at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and fitted for to go to <hi>Virginia,</hi> having ſome Paſſengers to deliver there: and with her returned ſundry of thoſe from <hi>Plimouth,</hi> which came over on their particular account; ſome out of diſcontent and diſlike of the Country, and others by reaſon of Fire that burnt their Houſes and all their Proviſions,<note place="margin">This was on the fifth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 1624.</hi>
                  </note> ſo as they were neceſſitated thereunto. This Fire was by ſome of the Seamen, that were Royſtering in an Houſe where it firſt began, making a great Fire, the weather being cold, which brake out of the Chimney into the Thatch, and burnt three Houſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed all their Goods and Proviſions. The Houſe in which it began, was right againſt their Store-houſe at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> which they had much ado to ſave; in which was the Common Store of the Proviſions of the Plantation, which had it been loſt, the ſame had been overthrown: but through Gods mercy it was ſaved, by the diligence of the people, and care of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and thoſe about him. Some would have had the Goods thrown out, but if they had, there would have been much loſt by the rude Company belonging to the two fore-named Ships, which were almoſt all on ſhore at this time; but a truſty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were placed within, as well as ſuch as were mean-while imployed in quenching the Fire without, that if neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired they might have them all out with ſpeed: for they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96779:32"/>
ſuſpected ſome malicious dealing, if not plain Treachery; and whether it was onely ſuſpected or no, God knows: but this is certain, that when the Tumult was greateſt, there was a voice heard (but from whence it came is uncertain) that bade them <hi>look well about them, for all were not friends that were then about them;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and ſoon after, when the vehemency of the Fire was over, ſmoke was ſeen to ariſe within a Shed that was joyned to the end of the aforeſaid Store-houſe, which was wattled up with boughs, in the withered leaves whereof the fire being kindled, which ſome running to quench, found a long Fire-brand of about an Ell long, lying under the wall on the inſide, which could not come thither by caſualty, but muſt be laid there by ſome hand, in the judgement of all that ſaw it. But God kept them from this danger, whatever might be intended.</p>
               <p>But to return again to ſpeak ſomething of the aforeſaid Captain <hi>Gorges,</hi> after he had been at the Eaſtward and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedited ſome occaſions there, he and ſome that depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him returned for <hi>England,</hi> having ſcarcely ſaluted the Country in his Government, finding the ſtate of things not to anſwer his quality and condition; his people diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſome went for <hi>England,</hi> others for <hi>Virginia,</hi> ſome few remained, and were helped with ſupplies from <hi>Plimouth:</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, the ſaid Captain brought over a Miniſter with him, one Mr. <hi>Morrel,</hi> who returned for <hi>England</hi> about a year after him, he took ſhip at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and had a certain power and authority of ſuperintendency over other Churches grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and inſtructions for that end; but he never ſhewed it, or made any uſe of it, but only ſpake of it to ſome of <hi>Plimouth</hi> at his going away. This was in effect the end of the ſecond Plantation, in the aforenamed place called <hi>Weſaguſquaſet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were alſo ſome ſcattering beginnings made in other places, as at <hi>Paſcataqua,</hi> by Mr. <hi>David Thompſon;</hi> and at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hegin,</hi> and ſome other places, by ſundry others.</p>

               <p>THe time of new Election of Officers being come for this year at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> the number of their people being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and their troubles and occaſions therewith; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour deſired them to change the perſons, as well as renew the Election, and alſo to adde more Aſſiſtants to the Governour for help and counſel, and the better carrying on of publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, ſhewing that it was neceſſary it ſhould ſo be; for if it were any honour or benefit, it was fit that others ſhould be made partakers of it; if it was a burden (as doubtleſs it was) it was but equal that others ſhould help to bear it, and that this was the end of yearly Elections.</p>
               <p>The concluſion was, that whereas there was before but one Aſſiſtant, they now choſe five, giving the Governour a double voice; and afterwards they encreaſed them to ſeven, which courſe hath continued in that Colony until this day.</p>
               <p>In the month of <hi>March,</hi> in this year Mr. <hi>Edward Winſlow</hi> arrived at <hi>Plimouth</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> having bin imployed as agent for that Plantation, on ſundry occaſions, with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Adventurers in <hi>England,</hi> who brought a conſiderable ſupply with him, the ſhip being bound on a fiſhing voyage; and with him came Mr. <hi>John Lyford</hi> a Miniſter, which was ſent over by ſome of the Adventurers.</p>

They gave him the beſt entertainment they could, in all ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and as their Governour had uſed in all weighty affairs, to conſult with their Elder Mr. <hi>Brewſter,</hi> together with his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; ſo now he called Mr. <hi>Lyford</hi> alſo on ſuch like occaſions: after ſome ſhort time, he deſired to joyn himſelf a member to their Church, and was accordingly received; he made a large confeſſion of his Faith, and an acknowledgement of his former diſorderly walking, and his being intangled with many Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which had bin a burden to his Conſcience, and bleſſed God for this oportunity of freedome and liberty, with many more ſuch like expreſſions; in ſome ſhort time he fell into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Mr. <hi>John Oldham,</hi> who was a copartner with him in his after courſes; not long after, both <hi>Oldham</hi> and he grew very perverſe, and ſhewed a ſpirit of great malignancy, drawing as many into a faction as they could: were they never ſo vile or prophane, they did nouriſh and abet them in all their doings, ſo they would but cleave to them, and ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church: ſo as there was nothing but private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and whiſperings amongſt them, they feeding themſelves and others, with what they ſhould bring to paſs in <hi>England</hi> by the faction of their<note n="*" place="margin">That is, ſome of the Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who proved in the iſſue Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to the Plantation.</note> friends there; which brought others as well as themſelves into a fools Paradice, yet they could not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo cloſely, but both much of their doings and ſayings were diſcovered, although outwardly they ſet a fair face of things.</p>
               <p>At length, when the Ship he came in was ready to return for <hi>England,</hi> and it was obſerved that <hi>Lyford</hi> was long in writing, and ſent many Letters, and could not forbear to communicate to his Intimates ſuch things as made them laugh in their ſleeves, and thought he had done their errand ſufficiently: The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96779:33"/>
and ſome of his friends knowing how things ſtood in reference to ſome known adverſaries in <hi>England,</hi> and what hurt theſe things might do, took a boat and went out with the ſhip, a league or two to ſea, and called for all <hi>Lyfords</hi> and <hi>Oldhams</hi> Letters, Mr. <hi>William Pierce</hi> being Maſter of the ſhip, and knew well their evil dealings, (both in <hi>England</hi> and here) afforded them all the aſſiſtance he could; he found about twenty of <hi>Lyfords</hi> Letters, many of them large, and full of ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and falſe accuſations, tending not only to their prejudice, but ruine and utter ſubverſion; moſt of them they let paſs, only took copies of them, but ſome of the moſt material, they ſent true copies of them and kept the originals, leſt he ſhould deny them, and that they might produce his own hand againſt him; amongſt theſe Letters they found the copies of two Letters, which were ſent in a Letter of his to Mr. <hi>John Pember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> a Miniſter, and a great oppoſite to the Plantation; theſe two Letters of which he took the copies, were the one of them writen by a Gentleman in <hi>England</hi> to Mr. <hi>Brewſter</hi> here, the other by Mr. <hi>Winſlow</hi> to Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> at his coming away, as the ſhip lay at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> they lying ſealed in the great Cabbin, whiles Mr. <hi>Winſlow</hi> was buſie about the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the ſhip, this ſly Merchant opens them, takes copies of them, and ſeals them up again, and not only ſeals the copies of them thus, <hi>To his Friend and their Adverſary,</hi> but addes thereto in the Margent many ſcurrilous and flouting Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In the evening the Governour returned, and they were ſomewhat blank at it; but after ſome weeks when they heard nothing, they then were as brisk as ever, thinking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had been known, but all was gone currant, and that the Governour went out but to diſpatch his own Letters.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why the Governour and the reſt concealed theſe things, was to let things ripen, that they might the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their intents, and ſee who were their adherents; becauſe among the reſt, they found a Letter of one of their confederates, in which was written, that Mr. <hi>Oldham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lyford</hi> intended a reformation in Church and Common-wealth, and as ſoon as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96779:34"/>
the ſhip was gone they intended to joyn together and have the Sacrament; few of <hi>Oldhams</hi> Letters were found in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſearch, being ſo bad a Scribe as his hand was ſcarce legible, yet he was as deep in the miſchief as the other; and thinking they were now ſtrong enough, they began to pick quarrels at every thing. <hi>Oldham</hi> being called to watch (according to order) refuſeth to come, fell out with the Captain, called him <hi>Raſcall,</hi> and <hi>beggarly Raſcall,</hi> and reſiſted him, and drew his knife at him, though he offered him no wrong, nor gave him any ill terms, but with all fairneſs required him to do his duty; the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hearing the tumult, ſent to quiet it; but he ranted with great fury, and called them all <hi>Traitors:</hi> but being committed to Priſon, after a while he came to himſelf, and with ſome ſlight puniſhment was let go upon his behaviour for further Cenſure; but to cut things ſhort, at length it grew to this iſſue, that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> with his accomplices, without either ſpeaking one word either to the Governour, Church or Elder, withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſet up a publick meeting apart on the Lords-day, with ſundry ſuch inſolent carriages too long here to relate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning more publickly to act that which they had been long plotting.</p>
               <p>It was now thought high time to prevent further miſchief, to call them to account; ſo the Governour called a Court, and ſummoned the whole company togher, and they charged <hi>Lyford</hi> and <hi>Oldham</hi> with ſuch things as they were guilty of reſpecting the premiſes; but they were ſtiff, and ſtood reſolutely upon the denial of moſt things, and required proof: they firſt alledged what was writ, compared with their practiſes here; that it was evident they joyned in plotting againſt them, and diſturbed their peace in their Civil and Church-ſtate, which was moſt injurious, for both they and all the world knew they came hither to enjoy the liberty of their Conſciences, in the free uſe of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and for that end had ventured their lives, and paſſed through ſo much hardſhip hitherto, and they and their friends had born the charge of theſe beginnings, which was not ſmall, and that he <hi>(viz.) Lyford,</hi> for his part was ſent over on this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96779:34"/>
charge, and both he and his great family was maintained on the ſame; and for him to plot againſt them, and ſeek their ruine, was moſt unjuſt and perfideous.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Lyford</hi> denied, and made ſtrange of ſundry things laid to his charge. Then his Letters were produced, at which he was ſtruck mute. <hi>Oldham</hi> began to be furious, and to rage, becauſe they had intercepted their Letters, provoked the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Mutiny in ſuch words as theſe; <hi>My Maſters, where are your hearts? now ſhew your courage: you have often complained to me ſo and ſo, now is the time, if you will do any thing, I will ſtand by you, &amp;c.</hi> thinking that every one knowing his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that had fooled or flattered him, or otherwiſe, or that in their Diſcontent uttered any thing unto him, would now ſide with him in open Rebellion: But he was deceived, for not a man opened his mouth, all were ſilent.</p>
               <p>Then the Governour took pains in Convicting <hi>Lyford</hi> of his Hypocriſie and Treachery, in abuſing his friends, in taking Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of their Letters in an under-hand way, and ſending them abroad to their diſgrace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and produced them, and his own Letters under his own Hand, which he could not deny, and cauſed them to be read before all the people; at which all his Confedrates were blank, and had not a word to ſay. But after awhile he began to ſay, <hi>That ſundry had made ſome Complaints unto him, and informed him of divers things:</hi> which being there preſent, and the particulars named to them, they denied.</p>
               <p>Then they dealt with him about his Diſſembling in the Church, and that he profeſſed to concur with them in all things, and what a large Confeſſion he had made at his admittance; and that he held not himſelf a Miniſter, till he had a new Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet now he conteſted againſt them, and drew a Company apart, and ſequeſtred himſelf, and would go about to adminiſter the Sacraments by his former Calling, without ever acquainting them with it. In concluſion he was fully convicted, and burſt out into tears, and confeſt <hi>be feared he was a Reprobate, his ſins were ſo great that he doubted that God would not pardon them, he was unſavoury ſalt,</hi> &amp;c. and that <hi>he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96779:35"/>
had ſo wronged them, as he could never make them amends;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing <hi>all he had written againſt them was falſe and naught, both for matter and manner:</hi> And all this he did with as much fulneſs as words and tears could expreſs.</p>
               <p>After their Trial and Conviction, the Court ſentenced them to be expelled the Plantation; <hi>John Oldham</hi> preſently to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, though his Wife and Family had liberty to ſtay all Winter, or longer, untill he could make proviſion to remove them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably. <hi>Lyford</hi> had liberty to ſtay ſix Months; it was with ſome eye to his releaſe, if he carried himſelf well in the mean time, and that his Repentance proved ſound. <hi>Lyford</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his Cenſure was farre leſs then he deſerved, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he confeſſed his ſin publickly in the Church with tears, more largely then before. I ſhall here relate it as I finde it penned by ſome who took it from his own mouth as himſelf uttered it.</p>
               <p>Acknowledging, <hi>That he had done very evil, and ſlanderouſly abuſed them; and thinking moſt of the people would take part with him, he thought to have carried all by violence and ſtrong hand againſt them; and that God might juſtly lay innocent blood to his charge, for he knew not what hurt might have come by theſe his Writings, and bleſſed God that they were ſtayed; and that he ſpared not to take knowledge from any of any evil that was ſpoken, but ſhut his eyes and ears againſt all the good; and that if God ſhould make him a Vagabond in the earth, as was</hi> Cain, <hi>it was but juſt:</hi> and he confeſſed <hi>three things to be the cauſes of this his doings, Pride, Vain-glory, and Self-love:</hi> amplifying theſe Heads with many other expreſſions in the particulars of them, ſo as they began to conceive good thoughts of him upon his Repentance, and admitted him to teach amongſt them as before; yea ſundry tender-hearted perſons amongſt them were ſo taken with his ſigns of Sorrow and Repentance, as they profeſſed they would fall upon their knees to have his Cenſure remitted and releaſed. But that which made them all ſtand amazed in the end (and may do all others that ſhall come to hear the ſame, for a rarer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident can ſcarcely be named) was, that after two Months
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96779:35"/>
time all his former Confeſſions, Convictions, and publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements, both in the preſence of God and his Church, and the whole Company, with ſo many Tears, and ſad cenſures of himſelf, he ſhould go again to juſtifie what he had done; for ſecretly he wrote a ſecond Letter to the Adventurers in <hi>England,</hi> in which he juſtified all his former Writings,<note place="margin">The Copy of this Letter is extant but too large to be here inſerted.</note> ſave in ſome things which tended to their damage.</p>

               <head>1625.</head>
               <p>AT the time of their Election Court, <hi>John Oldham</hi> came again amongſt them; and though it was a part of his Cenſure for his former Mutiny, <hi>Not to return without leave firſt obtained,</hi> yet he preſumed without leave at all to come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet on and hardened by the ill counſel of others; and not onely ſo, but ſuffered his unruly paſſion to run beyond the bounds and limits of all Reaſon and Modeſty, inſomuch that ſome ſtrangers that were with him were aſhamed of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and rebuked him: but all Reproofs were but as Oyl to the fire, and made the flame of his choller the greater. He called them all to naught in his fury, an hundred <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Traytors:</hi> but in concluſion, they Committed him untill he was tamer, and then appointed a Guard of Musketeers, which he was to paſs thorow, and every one was ordered to give him a blow on his Hinder-parts with the Butt-end of his Musket, and then he was conveyed to the Water-ſide, where a Boat was ready to carry him away, with this Farewell, <hi>Go and mend your Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the removal of his Family, he fell into ſome ſtraights, and about a year after intended a Voyage to <hi>Virginia:</hi> and ſo it pleaſed God, that himſelf and ſundry paſſengers being in the Barque, they were in great danger, ſo as they deſpaired of life, and fell to Prayer, and to Examination of their Hearts and Conſciences, and confeſſed ſuch ſins as moſt burthened them;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96779:36"/>
and the ſaid <hi>John Oldham</hi> did make a free and large Confeſſion of the wrongs he had done to the Church and People at <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> in many particulars; that <hi>as he had ſought their Ruine, ſo God had now met with him, and might deſtroy him;</hi> yea, <hi>he feared that they all fared the worſe for his ſake: He prayed God to forgive him,</hi> and made Vows, <hi>That if the Lord ſpared his life, he would become otherwiſe.</hi> This was reported by ſome of good Credit not long ſince living in the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Bay, that were themſelves partners in the ſame danger, which was on the Sholes of <hi>Cape Cod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It pleaſed God to ſpare their lives, but they loſt their vayage; and in time afterwards the ſaid Mr. <hi>John Oldham</hi> carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fairly towards them,<note place="margin">He was a man of parts, but high-ſpirited, and extremely paſſionate, which marred all in point of right improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them.</note> and acknowledged the hand of God to be with them, and ſeemed to have an honourable reſpect of them, and ſo far made his peace with them, as he had liberty to go and come at his pleaſure, and in ſome time after went on tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a ſmall veſſel amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> and being weakly manned, upon ſome quarrel betwixt them, they ſlew him with an hatchet: this his death being one ground of the <hi>Pequot</hi> war, of which afterwards in its proper place.</p>
               <p>The time being expired that Mr. <hi>John Lyford</hi> his Cenſure was to take place, he was ſo far from anſwering their hopes by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, as he had doubled his evil, as before-mentioned: But firſt behold the hand of God concerning him, wherein that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is verified,<note place="margin">Pſal. 7.15.</note> 
                  <hi>he hath made a pit and digged it, and is fallen into the pit that he made:</hi> he thought to bring ſhame and diſgrace upon them, but inſtead of that, opens his own to all the world; for his wife who was a prudent ſober woman, taking notice of his falſe and deceitful carriage about the premiſes, in grief of minde expreſſed her fears, that God would bring upon himſelf and his family, ſome ſad judgement for theſe and other his wicked practiſes, and related that he had a <hi>Baſtard</hi> by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther woman, before marriage with her, which he denied to her with an oath, but it afterwards appeared to be ſo: and another miſcarriage of the like nature, more odiouſly circumſtanced, was alſo diſcovered, for which he was forced to leave <hi>Ireland;</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:96779:36"/>
and ſo came <hi>New-England</hi> to be troubled with him. Being baniſhed hence, he went firſt to <hi>Nantasket,</hi> then to <hi>Salem,</hi> and after to <hi>Virginia,</hi> where he ſhortly after died.</p>
               <p>I have been too tedious in my relating the plots of theſe wicked <hi>Machavillians:</hi> But to conclude, the Reader may take notice, that God obſerved and brought to nought their wicked devices, was a defence to the innocent, and caught them in the ſnares they privily layed for them, puniſhing one ſin by another, until he had accompliſhed the freedom of his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the overthrow of his and their enemies; for which his mercy, let his holy Name be praiſed for evermore.</p>
               <p>This ſtorm thus blown over, yet ſundry ſad effects followed, for the company of the Merchant Adventurers brake in pieces hereupon, and the greateſt part wholly deſerted the Colony, but yet God took care of it; for although ſundry of them fell off and adventured no more towards the ſupport thereof, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proved manifeſt adverſaries thereunto then otherwiſe: and the reſt, partly becauſe they were grown (ſome of them) low in their eſtates, and there being ſmall hopes of returns to their expectations; although courteous in words and well wiſhes, yet afforded little or no help after this, ſo that the Plantation was fain to ſtand on their own legs, being indeed marvellouſly ſupported by the Lord, for it pleaſed him ſo to bleſs their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, as that they raiſed great crops of <hi>Indian Corn</hi> (about this time) ſo as they had enough, and to ſpare, and began to have thoughts of improving part of it in a way of trading with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and having only two ſhallops, and no bigger veſſels, they laid a deck on the one of them in the midſhips, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the corn dry from weather, &amp; ſo ſent her laden with corn to a place call'd <hi>Kenebek,</hi> about fifty leagues off to the Eaſtwards: and notwithſtanding they were ſtrangers to the way, and place of trade, and to the people, and having no ſeamen to go with them, and at that ſeaſon, being the latter end of the year and drawing on to winter; yet it pleaſed God to preſerve them, and ſo to bleſs their endeavours, as that they returned in ſafety, and with good ſucceſs, it being the firſt enterpriſe they atchieved
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96779:37"/>
in this kind (at leaſt) ſo far, and it proved an inlet to a further trade, which was greatly beneficial to them afterwards.</p>
               <p>And here I may not omit the obſervable diſpenſation of Gods providence, reſpecting his dealing with the Adventurers fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, in reference unto two ſhips they ſent unto theſe parts about that time, on a fiſhing voyage only upon their own account, having left the Plantation to ſhift for themſelves; one of theſe ſhips was a ſmall one <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>James</hi> forenamed, which was well laden with good <hi>Cor fiſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>800</hi> weight of Beaver, with other Furres a good quantity.</note> and in her a great quantity likewiſe of <hi>Beaver</hi> and other furs, which was ſent by the Plantation to the Adventurers, and returned for <hi>England:</hi> the other ſhip was alſo laden with good <hi>dry fiſh,</hi> and ſhe alſo returned with her; being thus well fraighted, they went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovingly and joyfully away, the greater ſhip towing the leſſer at her ſtern all the way over-bound, and had ſuch fair weather, as they never caſt her off, till they were ſhot deep into the <hi>Engliſh Chanel,</hi> almoſt within ſight of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and yet there ſhe was unhappily taken by a <hi>Turks-man</hi> of war, &amp; carried into <hi>Sally,</hi> where the Maſter and Men were made Slaves, and many of the Beaver-skins were ſold for four pence a piece. Thus were all their hopes daſhed in this reſpect, and the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full News they went to carry home, turned into heavy Tidings. Some thought this a Hand of God for ſome unkindneſs ſhewed to the Plantation, by exaction upon them in reference to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of goods they a little before had ſent over to them on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Rates: But Gods Judgements are unſearchable, neither ought we to be too bold therewith. But however, it ſhews us the uncertainty of all humane things, and what little cauſe there is in joying in them, or truſting to them.</p>
               <p>In the bigger of theſe Ships Captain <hi>Miles Standiſh</hi> went over as Agent in the behalf of the Plantation, in reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome particulars yet depending betwixt them and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers; as alſo to the Honourable Council of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> and notwithſtanding ſome Difficulty he met with in his occaſions, by reaſon of the Peſtilence which was then ſo hot in the City of <hi>London,</hi> yet he accompliſhed his buſineſs ſo, as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96779:37"/>
he left things in a fair way for future Compoſition betwixt the ſaid Merchant-Adventurers and the Plantation: and he ſpake alſo with ſome of the Honourable Council afore-named, who promiſed all helpfulneſs to the Plantation that lay in them. About this time it pleaſed the Lord likewiſe to give them peace, health, and good ſucceſs on their endeavours, his holy Name be praiſed.</p>

All which things before related, being well weighed and laid together, it could not but ſtrike them with great perplexity, and to look humanely on the ſtate of things as they preſented themſelves at this time, it is a marvel it did not wholly diſcourage and ſink them, but they gathered up their ſpirits, and the Lord ſo helped them (whoſe work they had in hand) as now when they were very low, they began to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and being ſtripped (in a manner) of all humane helps and hopes, he brought things about otherwiſe in his divine Providence, ſo as they were not only upheld and ſuſtained, but their proceedings both honoured and imitated by others, as by the ſequel will appear.</p>

                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:96779:38"/>Likewiſe this Year they began to make ſome diſtribution of Lands, having had hitherto but to every perſon one Acre al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him as to propriety, beſides their Home-ſteads, or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-plots; the reaſon was that they might keep together, both for more ſafety and defence, and the better Improvement of the general Imployments: which condition of theirs brings to minde that which may be read in <hi>Pliny</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings in <hi>Romulus</hi> time,<note place="margin">Pliny, lib. <hi>18.</hi> Chap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> how every man contented himſelf with two Acres of Land, and had no more aſſigned them: and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>It was thought a great Reward to receive at the hands of the People of</hi> Rome <hi>a Pinte of Corn;</hi> and long after, <hi>the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Preſent given to a Captain that had got a Victory over their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, was as much ground as he could Till in one day;</hi> and <hi>he was not accounted a good, but a dangerous man, that would not content himſelf with ſeven Acres of Land;</hi> as alſo <hi>how they did pound their Corn in Mortars,</hi> as theſe people were forced to do many years before they could get a Mill.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding as aboveſaid, ſo ſmall a portion of Land ſerved them at the firſt, yet afterwards for divers Reaſons moving thereunto, they were neceſſitated to lay out ſome larger Proportions to each perſon; yet reſolving to keep ſuch a <hi>mean</hi> in diſtribution of Lands, as ſhould not hinder their growth by others coming to them, and therefore accordingly allotted to every one in each Family Twenty Acres to be laid out, five Acres in breadth by the Water-ſide, and four Acres in length.</p>
               <p>I may not omit the inſerting of a particular that fell out this year, in reference unto a Ship with many Paſſengers in her, and ſome conſiderable goods, which was bound for <hi>Virginia,</hi> who had loſt themſelves at Sea, either by the inſufficiency of the Maſter, or his illneſs (for he was ſick, and lame of the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> ſo as he could but lye in the Cabbin-door and give direction, and (it ſhould ſeem) was badly aſſiſted either with Mate or Marriners) or elſe the fear of, and the unrulineſs of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers was ſuch, as they made them ſteer a Courſe between the Southweſt and Northweſt, that they might fall with ſome
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96779:39"/>
Land, whatever it was they cared not, for they had been ſix weeks at Sea and had no Beer, nor Water, nor Wood left, but had burnt up all their empty Cask, onely one of the Company had a Hogſhead of Wine or two, which was alſo almoſt ſpent, ſo as they feared they ſhould be ſtarved at Sea, or conſumed with Diſeaſes, which made them run this deſperate Courſe. But it pleaſed God, that although they came ſo near the Sholes of <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> or elſe ran ſtumbling over them in the night they knew not how, they came before a ſmall Harbour that lieth about the middle of <hi>Mannamoiet Bay,</hi> to the Southward of <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> and with a ſmall gale of wind, and about a high wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, touched upon a Barre of Sand that lieth before it, but had no hurt, the Sea being ſmooth ſo they laid out an Anchor; but towards Evening the wind ſprang up at Sea, and was ſo rough as brake their Cable, and beat them over the Barre into the Harbour, where they ſaved their Lives and Goods: for although with much beating they had ſprung a butt-end of a Plank, yet they ſoon got over, and ran upon a dry Flatt within the Harbour cloſe to a Beach, and at a low water got out their Goods, and were not a little glad that they had ſaved their Lives. But when they had refreſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not knowing where they were, nor what to do, were much troubled; but ſoon after ſaw ſome <hi>Indians</hi> come towards them in Canooes, which made them ſtand upon their guard, but when they heard ſome of them ſpeak <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they were not a little revived; eſpecially when they heard them ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were not the Governour of <hi>Plimouths</hi> Men, or Friends, and that they would bring them to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> houſes, or carry their Letters: and when they had feaſted theſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> and given them many gifts, they ſent two men and a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with them to the Governour of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> by which he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of their condition, and took order for their ſupply: they hoping by mending of their Ship to recover her to go to Sea again, and accordingly did mend her; but afterwards ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but bad Moring, was put on ſhore again, and ſuffered ſo much ſhipwrack as ſhe never got off more, but all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96779:39"/>
were forced to repair to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> where they continued the beſt part of a year, being courteouſly entertained, and ſo were diſperſed: The greateſt part of them went to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and ſome remained in the Country. The chief amongſt them were Mr. <hi>Fells,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sibſey,</hi> and the Maſters Name was <hi>Johnſton</hi> a Scotſman.</p>
               <p>This Year the Plantation of <hi>Plimouth</hi> received Meſſages from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Plantation,<note place="margin">The Dutch had trading in theſe Southern parts divers years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Engliſh came, but they began no Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation until af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Engliſh came, and were here ſeated.</note> ſent unto them from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour there, written both in <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French:</hi> The ſum of the Letters forementioned were, To Congratulate the <hi>Engliſh</hi> here, taking notice of much that might engage them to a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Correſpondency and good Neighbourhood, as, The propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of their Native Country, Their long continued Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and deſired to fall into a way of ſome Commerce and Trade with them.</p>
               <p>To which the Governour and Council of <hi>Plimouth</hi> returned anſwerable courteous acceptance of their loving Propoſitions, reſpecting their good Neighbourhood in general, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for Commerce: And accordingly the <hi>Dutch</hi> not long after ſent their Secretary Mr. <hi>Iſaac de Roſier</hi> with Letters and goods, who laid the foundation of a Trade that continued between them many years after, to their mutual benefit. They alſo brought the <hi>Engliſh</hi> acquainted with the trading of <hi>Wampam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peag,</hi> untill then little known to us, nor eſteemed by us, but was after of good valuation, and profitable. Although for the ſpace of 20 years it was of great eſteem amongſt the Natives in divers parts of the Country, ſo as it made the <hi>Indians</hi> in theſe parts Rich, Proud and Powerful; yet untill they had ſtore of it, they could not attain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ammunition, but were fain to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their own Artillery of Bowes and Arrows: But when as they learned to make ſtore of <hi>Wampam,</hi> they furniſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Guns, Powder and Shot, which no Laws can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, by reaſon of the baſeneſs of ſundry unworthy perſons, both <hi>Engliſh, Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> which may turn to the ruine of many: for hitherto the <hi>Indians</hi> of theſe parts had no Pieces, nor other Arms but their Bowes and Arrows and Clubs,

nor of many years after; neither durſt they ſcarce handle a Gun, though out of kelter, it was a terrour to them: but thoſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> to the Eaſtern parts which had Commerce with the <hi>French,</hi> got Pieces of them, and they in the end made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Trade of it; and in time our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fiſhermen, led with the like Covetouſneſs, followed their example for their own gain: but upon Complaint againſt them, it pleaſed the Kings Majeſty to prohibit the ſame by a ſtrict Proclamation, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>that no ſort of Arms or Ammunition ſhould by any of His Subjects be Traded with them.</hi>

               <p>THis Year died Mr. <hi>Richard Warren,</hi> who hath been men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tioned before in this Book, and was an uſeful Inſtrument, and during his life bare a deep ſhare in the Difficulties and Troubles of the firſt Settlement of the Plantation of <hi>New-Plimouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans name is here occaſionally uſed, &amp; although he came over in year <hi>1625.</hi> yet theſe paſſages in reference to <hi>Morton,</hi> fell out about this year, and therefore referred to this place.</note>Whereas about three years before this time there came over one Captain <hi>Wollaſton,</hi> a man of conſiderable parts, and with him three or four more of ſome Eminency, who brought with them a great many Servants, with Proviſions, and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites for to begin a Plantation, and pitched themſelves in a place within the <hi>Maſſachuſets Bay,</hi> which they called after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by their Captains Name, <hi>Mount Wollaſton;</hi> which place is ſince called by the Name of <hi>Braintry.</hi> And amongſt others that came with him, there was one Mr. <hi>Thomas Morton,</hi> who it ſhould ſeem had ſome ſmall Adventure of his own or other mens amongſt them, but had little reſpect, and was ſlighted by the meaneſt Servants they kept. They having continued ſome time in <hi>New-England,</hi> and not finding things to anſwer their Expectation, nor Profit to ariſe as they looked for, the ſaid Captain <hi>Wollaſton</hi> takes a great part of the Servants, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and diſpoſed of them there, and writes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96779:40"/>
back to one Mr. <hi>Raſdale,</hi> one of his chief partners, (&amp; accounted their Merchant) to bring another part of them to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> likewiſe, intending to put them off there, as he had done the reſt; and he with the conſent of the ſaid <hi>Raſdale,</hi> appointed one whoſe Name was <hi>Filcher</hi> to be his Lieutenant, and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the remainder of the Plantation, untill he or <hi>Raſdale</hi> ſhould take further order thereabout.</p>
               <p>But the aforeſaid <hi>Morton</hi> (having more craft then honeſty) having been a <hi>Petty-fogger</hi> at <hi>Furnivals Inne;</hi> he in the others abſence watches an opportunity (Commons being but hard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them) and got ſome ſtrong drink, and other junkets, and made them a feaſt, and after they were merry, he began to tell them he would give them good Counſel: you ſee (ſaith he) that many of your fellows are carried to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and if you ſtay ſtill until <hi>Raſdales</hi> return, you will alſo be carried away and ſold for ſlaves with the reſt; therefore I would adviſe you to thruſt out this Lieutenant <hi>Filcher,</hi> and I having a part in the Plantation, will receive you as my partners and conſociates, ſo may you be free from ſervice, and we will Converſe, Plant, Trade and live together as equals (or to the like effect) This counſel was eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed, ſo they took opportunity,<note place="margin">See the ſad Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the want of good Government.</note> and thruſt Lieutenant <hi>Filcher</hi> out of doors, and would not ſuffer him to come any more amongſt them, but forced him to ſeek bread to eat, and other neceſſaries amongſt his neighbours, till he could get paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this they fell to great licentiouſneſs of life, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs, and the ſaid <hi>Morton</hi> became Lord of miſrule, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained (as it were) a ſchool of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and after they had got ſome goods into their hands, and got much by trading with the <hi>Indians,</hi> they ſpent it as vainly, in quaffing and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Wine and ſtrong Liquors, in great exceſs (as ſome have reported) <hi>Ten pounds worth</hi> in a Morning, ſetting up a <hi>May-pole,</hi> drinking and dancing about it, and frisking about it, like ſo many <hi>Fairies</hi> or <hi>Furies</hi> rather, yea and worſe practiſes, as if they had anew revived and celebrated the feaſt of the <hi>Romans</hi> Goddeſs <hi>Flora,</hi> or the beaſtly practiſes of the mad <hi>Bacchana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:96779:41"/>
The ſaid <hi>Morton</hi> likewiſe to ſhew his Poetry, compoſed ſundry Rythmes and Verſes, ſome tending to laciviouſneſs, and others to the detraction and ſcandal of ſome perſons names, which he affixed to his Idle or Idol <hi>May-pole:</hi> they changed alſo the name of their place, and inſtead of calling it <hi>Mount Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſton,</hi> they called it the <hi>Merry Mount,</hi> as if this jollity would have laſted alwayes. But this continued not long, for ſhortly after, that Worthy Gentleman Mr. <hi>John Endicot,</hi> who brought over a Patent under the Broad Seal of <hi>England</hi> for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> viſiting theſe parts, cauſed that <hi>May-pole</hi> to be cut down, and rebuked them for their propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and admoniſhed them to look to it that they walked better; ſo the name was again changed, and called <hi>Mount Dagon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to maintain this riotous Prodigality and profuſe expence, the ſaid <hi>Morton</hi> thinking himſelf lawleſs, and hearing what gain the Fiſhermen made of trading of Pieces, Powder and Shot; he as head of this conſortſhip, began the practice of the ſame in theſe parts: and firſt he taught the <hi>Indians</hi> how to uſe them, to charge and diſcharge them, and what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of powder to give the Piece, according to the ſize or big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſame, and what ſhot to uſe for Fowl, and what for Deer: and having thus inſtructed them, he imployed ſome of them to Hunt and Fowl for him; ſo as they became ſomewhat more active in that imployment then any of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by reaſon of their ſwiftneſs of foot, and nimbleneſs of body, being alſo quick-ſighted, and by continual exerciſe, well knowing the haunt of all ſorts of game; ſo as when they ſaw the, execution that a Piece would do, and the benefit that might come by the ſame, they became very eager after them, and would not ſtick to give any price they could attain to for them; accounting their Bows and Arrows but bables in compariſon of them.</p>
               <p>And here we may take occaſion to bewail the miſchief which came by this wicked man, and others like unto him; in that notwithſtanding all laws, for the reſtraint of ſelling Ammunition to the <hi>Natives,</hi> that ſo far baſe covetouſneſs prevailed, and doth ſtill prevail, as that the <hi>Salvages</hi> become amply furniſhed with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96779:41"/>
Guns, Powder, Shot, Rapiers, Piſtols, and alſo well-skilled in repairing of defective Arms: yea ſome have not ſpared to tell them how Gun-powder is made, and all the materials in it, and that they are to be had in their own Land; and would (no doubt, in caſe they could attain to the making of <hi>Salt-Peter</hi>) teach them to make Powder: and what miſchief may fall out unto the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in theſe parts thereby, let this peſtilent fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Morton</hi> (aforenamed) bear a great part of the blame and guilt of it to future Generations. But leſt I ſhould hold the <hi>Reader</hi> too long in the relation of the particulars of his vile actings; when as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that then lived up and down about the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> and in other places, perceiving the ſad conſequences of his trading, ſo as the <hi>Indians</hi> became furniſhed with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Arms &amp; Ammunition, and expert in the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them, and fearing they ſhould at one time or another get a blow thereby; and alſo taking notice, that if he were let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in his way, they ſhould keep no ſervants for him, becauſe he would entertain any how vile ſoever: Sundry of the chief of the ſtragling Plantations met together, and agreed by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſent to ſend to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> who were then of more ſtrength to joyn with them, to ſuppreſs this miſchief: who conſidering the particulars propoſed to them to joyn together to take ſome courſe with him, and finding them weighty, agreed together to take ſome ſpeedy courſe, to prevent (if it might be) the evil that was accrewing towards them; and reſolved firſt to admoniſh him of his wickedneſs reſpecting the premiſes, laying before him the injury he did to their common ſafety, and that his acting concerning the ſame, was againſt the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation: but he inſolently perſiſted on in his way, and ſaid, <hi>the King was dead, and his diſpleaſure with him, and threatned them that if they came to moleſt him, they ſhould look to themſelves;</hi> ſo that they ſaw there was no way but to take him by force: ſo they reſolved to proceed in ſuch a way, and obtained of the Governour of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to ſend Captain <hi>Standiſh</hi> and ſome other aid with him, to take the ſaid <hi>Morton</hi> by force, the which accordingly was done; but they found him to ſtand ſtifly on
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96779:42"/>
his defence, having made faſt his doors, armed his Conſorts, ſet Powder and Shot ready upon the Table; ſcoffed and ſcorned at them, and he and his Complices being filled with ſtrong drink, were deſperate in their way: but he himſelf coming out of doors to make a ſhot at Captain <hi>Standiſh,</hi> he ſtepping to him, put by his Piece and took him, and ſo little hurt was done; and ſo he was brought Priſoner to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and continued in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance until an opportunity of ſending him for <hi>England,</hi> which was done at their common charge, and Letters alſo with him, to the honourable Council for <hi>New-England,</hi> and returned again into the Country in ſome ſhort time, with leſs puniſhment then his demerits deſerved (as was apprehended.)</p>
               <p>The Year following he was again apprehended, and ſent for <hi>England,</hi> where he lay a conſiderable time in <hi>Exeter Goal:</hi> for beſides his miſcarriage here in <hi>New-England,</hi> he was ſuſpected to have murthered a man that had ventured monies with him, when he came firſt into <hi>New-England;</hi> and a warrant was ſent over from the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> to apprehend him, by virtue whereof, he was by the Governour of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and for other of his miſdemeanors amongſt them in that Government, they demoliſhed his Houſe, that it might no longer be a rooſt for ſuch unclean Birds: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he got free in <hi>England</hi> again, and wrote an Infamous and Scurrilous Book againſt many godly and chief men of the Country, full of lies and ſlanders, and full fraught with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane calumnies againſt their Names and Perſons, and the wayes of God. But to the intent I may not trouble the Reader any more with mentioning of him in this Hiſtory: In fine, ſundry years after he came again into the Country, and was impriſoned at <hi>Boſton</hi> for the aforeſaid Book and other things, but denied ſundry things therein, affirming his Book was adulterated. And ſoon after being grown old in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, at laſt ended his life at <hi>Paſcataqua.</hi> But I fear I have held the Reader too long about ſo unworthy a perſon, but hope it may be uſeful to take notice how wickedneſs was beginning, and would have further proceeded, had it not been prevented timely.</p>

and the chief of the Paſſengers that came over with them, with their profeſſed intentions, and conſulted with them about ſetling a Reformed Congregation; from whom they found a general and hearty Concurrence, ſo that after ſome Conference together about this matter, they pitched upon the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> for their entring into a ſolemn Covenant with God, and one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and alſo for the Ordaining of their Miniſters; of which they gave notice to the Church of <hi>Plimouth</hi> (that being the onely Church that was in the Country before them) the people made choice of Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi> for their Paſtor, and Mr. <hi>Higginſon</hi> for their Teacher. And accordingly it was deſired of Mr. <hi>Higginſon</hi> to draw up a Confeſſion of Faith and Covenant in Scripture-language; which being done, was agreed upon. And becauſe they foreſaw that this Wilderneſs might be looked upon as a place of Liberty, and therefore might in time be troubled with erroneous ſpirits, therefore they did put in one Article into the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> on purpoſe about <hi>the Duty and Power of the Magiſtrate in Matters of Religion.</hi> Thirty Copies of the foreſaid <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> being written out for the uſe of thirty perſons who were to begin the Work. When the ſixth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> came, it was kept as a day of Faſting and Prayer, in which after the Sermons and Prayers of the two Miniſters, in the end of the day, the foreſaid <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> being ſolemnly read, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named perſons did ſolemnly profeſs their Conſent thereunto: and then proceeded to the Ordaining of Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi> Paſtor, and Mr. <hi>Higginſon</hi> Teacher of the Church there. Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> the Governour of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and ſome others with him, coming by Sea, were hindred by croſs winds that they could not be there at the beginning of the day, but they came into the Aſſembly afterward, and gave them the <hi>right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,</hi> wiſhing all proſperity, and a bleſſed ſucceſs unto ſuch good beginnings. After which, at ſeveral times many others joyned to the Church in the ſame way. The <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> forementioned, was acknowledged onely as a Direction pointing unto that Faith and Covenant contained
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96779:44"/>
in the holy Scripture, and therefore no man was confined unto that form of words, but onely to the Subſtance, End and Scope of the matter contained therein: And for the Circumſtantial manner of joyning to the Church, it was ordered according to the wiſdome and faithfulneſs of the Elders, together with the liberty and ability of any perſon. Hence it was, that ſome were admitted by expreſſing their Conſent to that written <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith</hi> and <hi>Covenant;</hi> others did anſwer to queſtions about the Principles of Religion that were publickly propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; ſome did preſent their Confeſſion in writing, which was read for them; and ſome that were able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, did make their Confeſſion in their own words and way: A due reſpect was alſo had unto the Converſations of men, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were without Scandal. But ſome of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers that came over at the ſame time, obſerving that the Miniſters did not at all uſe the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and that they did adminiſter Baptiſm and the Lords Supper without the Ceremonies, and that they profeſſed alſo to uſe Diſcipline in the Congregation againſt ſcandalous perſons, by a perſonal application of the Word of God as the caſe might require, and that ſome that were ſcandalous were denied admiſſion into the Church, they began to raiſe ſome trouble: of theſe Mr. <hi>Samuel Brown</hi> and his Brother were the chief; the one being a Lawyer, the other a Merchant, both of them amongſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the firſt Patentees, men of Eſtates, and men of Parts and port in the place. Theſe two Brothers gathered a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany together in a place diſtinct from the publick Aſſembly, and there ſundry times the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> was read unto ſuch as reſorted thither. The Governour Mr. <hi>Endicot</hi> taking notice of the diſturbance that began to grow amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by this means, he convented the two Brothers before him. They accuſed the Miniſters as <hi>departing from the Orders of the Church of England, that they were Separatiſts, and would be Anabaptiſts, &amp;c. but for themſelves, they would hold to the Orders of the Church of England.</hi> The Miniſters anſwered for themſelves, <hi>They were neither</hi> Separatiſts <hi>nor</hi> Anabaptiſts,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96779:44"/>
                  <hi>they did not ſeparate from the Church of</hi> England, <hi>nor from the Ordinances of God there, but onely from the Corruptions and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders there;</hi> and <hi>that they came away from the Common-Prayer and Ceremonies, and had ſuffered much for their Non-Conformity in their Native Land, and therefore being in a place where they might have their liberty, they neither could nor would uſe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they judged the impoſition of theſe things to be ſinful Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the Worſhip of God.</hi> The Governour and Council, and the generality of the people, did well approve of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Anſwer: and therefore finding thoſe two Brothers to be of high Spirits, and their ſpeeches and practiſes tending to Mutiny and Faction, the Governour told them, <hi>That</hi> New-England <hi>was no place for ſuch as they;</hi> and therefore he ſent them both back for <hi>England</hi> at the return of the Ships the ſame year: and though they breathed out Threatnings both againſt the Governour and Miniſters there, yet the Lord ſo diſpoſed of all, that there was no further inconvenience followed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>The two Miniſters there being ſeriouſly ſtudious of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, they conſidered of the ſtate of their Children, together with their Parents; concerning which, Letters did paſs between Mr. <hi>Higginſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brewſter</hi> the reverend Elder of the Church of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and they did agree in their judgements, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning the <hi>Church-Memberſhip</hi> of the Children with their parents, and that Baptiſm was a ſeal of their <hi>Memberſhip,</hi> only when they were Adult, they being not ſcandalous, they were to be examined by the <hi>Church-Officers,</hi> and upon their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of their fitneſs, and upon the Childrens publick and perſonal owning of the Covenant, they were to be received unto the Lords Supper. Accordingly Mr. <hi>Higginſon's</hi> eldeſt Son, being about fifteen years of age, was owned to have been received a member together with his Parents, and being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately examined by the Paſtor Mr. <hi>Skelton,</hi> about his knowledge in the principles of Religion, he did preſent him before the Church when the Lords Supper was to be Adminiſtred, and the Childe then publickly and perſonally owning the Covenant of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96779:45"/>
the God of his Father, he was admitted unto the Lords Supper: it being then profeſſedly owned, according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. that the Children of the Church are holy unto the Lord as well as their Parents, accordingly the Parents owning and retaining the Baptiſm, which they themſelves received in their Infancy, in their Native Land, as they had any Children born, Baptiſm was adminiſtred unto them, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Children of ſuch as were members of that particular Church.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Higginſon</hi> lived but one year after the ſetling of the Church there, departed this life about the ſame time the next year, in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1630. Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi> lived until the year 1634. when he alſo quietly ſlept in the Lord, and were both buried at <hi>Salem.</hi> As it is an honour to be in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. ſo alſo to be firſt in the Lords work, and to be faithful in it, as theſe two holy men were; who made ſuch a beginning in <hi>Church-reformation,</hi> as was afterwards followed by many others.</p>
               <p>In the year 1634. Mr. <hi>Roger Williams</hi> removed from <hi>Plimouth</hi> to <hi>Salem:</hi> he had lived about three years at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> where he was well accepted as an aſſiſtant in the Miniſtry to Mr. <hi>Ralph Smith,</hi> then Paſtor of the Church there, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees venting of divers of his own ſingular opinions, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to impoſe them upon others, he not finding ſuch a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as he expected, he deſired his diſmiſſion to the Church of <hi>Salem,</hi> which though ſome were unwilling to, yet through the prudent counſel of Mr. <hi>Brewſter</hi> (the ruling Elder there) fearing that his continuance amongſt them might cauſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and there being then many able men in the Bay, they would better deal with him then themſelves could, and foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (what he profeſſed he feared concerning Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> which afterwards came to paſs) that he would run the ſame courſe of rigid Separation and Anabaptiſtry, which Mr. <hi>John Smith</hi> the Sebaptiſt at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> had done; the Church of <hi>Plimouth</hi> conſented to his diſmiſſion, and ſuch as did adhere to him were alſo diſmiſſed, and removed with him, or not long after him to <hi>Salem.</hi> He came to <hi>Salem</hi> in the time of Mr. <hi>Skeltons</hi> weakneſs,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96779:45"/>
who lived not long after Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> was come, whereupon after ſome time, the Church there called him to office; but he having in one years time, filled that place with principles of rigid ſeparation, and tending to Anabaptiſtry, the prudent Magiſtrates of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Juriſdiction, ſent to the Church of <hi>Salem,</hi> deſiring them to forbear calling him to office, which they not hearkening to, was a cauſe of much diſturbance; for Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> had begun, and then being in office, he proceeded more vigorouſly to vent many dangerous opinions, as amongſt many others theſe were ſome; <hi>That it is not lawful for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man to pray, nor to take an Oath, and in ſpecial, not the Oath of Fidelity to the Civil Government; nor was it lawful for a godly man to have communion either in Family Prayer, or in an Oath with ſuch as they judged unregenerate:</hi> and therefore he himſelf refuſed the Oath of Fidelity, and taught others ſo to do: alſo, <hi>That it was not lawful ſo much as to hear the godly Miniſters of England, when any occaſionally went thither,</hi> &amp; therefore he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed any <hi>Church-members</hi> that had done ſo, as for hainous ſin: alſo he ſpake dangerous words againſt the Patent, which was the foundation of the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Colony: alſo he affirmed, <hi>That the Magiſtrates had nothing to do in matters of the firſt Table, but only the ſecond; and that there ſhould be a general and unlimited Toleration of all Religions, and for any man to be puniſhed for any matters of his Conſcience, was perſecution.</hi> And further he procured the Church of <hi>Salems</hi> conſent unto letters of Admonition, which was written and ſent by him in their name, to the Churches at <hi>Boſton, Charlſtown, New-town</hi> (now <hi>Cambridge</hi>) &amp;c. accuſing the Magiſtrates that were members of the reſpective Churches, of ſundry hainous offences which he laid unto their charge, and though divers did acknowledge their error and gave ſatisfaction, yet Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> himſelf, notwithſtanding all the pains that was taken with him by Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and many others, to bring him to a ſight of his errors and miſcarriages, and notwithſtanding all the Courts gentle proceedings with him, he not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, but grew more violent in his way, inſomuch as he ſtaying
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96779:46"/>
at home in his own houſe, ſent a Letter, which was delivered and read in the publick Church aſſembly, the ſcope of which was to give them notice, <hi>That if the Church of</hi> Salem <hi>would not ſeparate not only from the Churches of</hi> Old-England, <hi>but the Churches of</hi> New-England <hi>too, he would ſeparate from them:</hi> the more prudent and ſober part of the Church being amazed at his way, could not yield unto him: whereupon he never came to the Church Aſſembly more, profeſſing ſeparation from them as Antichriſtian, and not only ſo, but he withdrew all private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Communion from any that would hold Communion with the Church there, inſomuch as he would not pray nor give thanks at meals with his own wife nor any of his family, becauſe they went to the Church Aſſemblies: divers of the weaker ſort of the Church-members, that had been throughly leavened with his Opinions, of which number were divers wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were zealous in their way, did by degrees fall off to him, inſomuch as he kept a meeting in his own houſe, unto which a numerous company did reſort, both on the Sabbath day and at other times, in way of ſeparation from, and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Church Aſſembly there; which the prudent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates underſtanding, and ſeeing things grow more and more towards a general diviſion and diſturbance, after all other means uſed in vain, they paſſed a ſentence of Baniſhment againſt him out of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Colony, as againſt a diſturber of the peace, both of the Church and Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>After which Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſat down in a place called <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> out of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Juriſdiction, and was followed by many of the members of the Church of <hi>Salem,</hi> who did zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly adhere to him, and who cried out of the Perſecution that was againſt him: ſome others alſo reſorted to him from other parts. They had not been long there together, but from rigid ſeparation they fell to Anabaptiſtry, renouncing the Baptiſm which they had received in their Infancy, and taking up another Baptiſm, and ſo began a Church in that way; but <hi>Mr. Williams</hi> ſtopped not there long, for after ſome time he told the people that had followed him, and joyned with him in a new Baptiſm,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96779:46"/>
that <hi>he was out of the way himſelf, and had miſ-led them, for he did not finde that there was any upon earth that could adminiſter Baptiſm, and therefore their laſt Baptiſm was a nullity, as well as their firſt; and therefore they muſt lay down all, and wait for the coming of new Apoſtles:</hi> and ſo they diſſolved themſelves, and turned <hi>Seekers,</hi> keeping that one Principle, <hi>That every one ſhould have liberty to Worſhip God according to the Light of their own Conſciences;</hi> but otherwiſe not owning any Churches or Ordinances of God any where upon Earth.</p>
               <p>Thus much was thought meet to be inſerted here concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great and lamentable Apoſtacy of Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> that it may be a Warning to all others to take heed of a gradual declining from, and forſaking the Churches of Chriſt, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God in them, leſt they be left of God to run ſuch a courſe as he hath done; <hi>Wherefore let him that thinks he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.12. As alſo to be a Motive to the Saints, to remember him unto God in their fervent Prayers for his return, he having been ſometimes an able Diſpenſer of the Word of God, and (in ſeveral reſpects) of an exemplary Converſation.</p>
               <p>And yet that there may be a ſtanding Evidence of the Care that was had in thoſe times to prevent the growth of Errours, and of the exerciſe of the Communion of Churches for that end, it is thought meet further to inſert this paſſage: That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the putting forth of the Civil Power of the Magiſtrate for the removing of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> from <hi>Salem,</hi> and beſides other means alſo uſed, there was a publick Admonition ſent in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the Church of <hi>Boſton</hi> to the Church of <hi>Salem,</hi> for the reducing of Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and the erring part of the Church.

               <p>THis Year it pleaſed God of his rich grace to Tranſport over into the Bay of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> divers honourable Perſonages, and many worthy Chriſtians, whereby the Lord began in a manifeſt manner and way to make known the great thoughts which he had of Planting the Goſpel in this remote and barbarous Wilderneſs, and honouring his own Way of Inſtituted Worſhip, cauſing ſuch and ſo many to adhere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and fall upon the practice thereof: Among the reſt, a chief one amongſt them was that famous Patern of Piety and Juſtice Mr. <hi>John Winthrop,</hi> the firſt Governour of that Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, accompanied with divers other precious Sons of <hi>Sion,</hi> which might be compared to the moſt fine gold. Amongſt whom alſo I might name that Reverend and Worthy man, Mr. <hi>John Wilſon,</hi> eminent for Love and Zeal; he likewiſe came over this year, and bare a great ſhare of the difficulties of theſe new beginnings with great chearfulneſs and alacrity of ſpirit: They came over with a Fleet of ten Ships, three of them arriving firſt at <hi>Salem,</hi> in which ſeveral of the chiefeſt of them came, who repaired ſundry of them in ſome ſhort time into the Bay of the <hi>Maſſachuſets;</hi> the other ſeven Ships ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Charlſtown,</hi> where it pleaſed the Lord to exerciſe them with much ſickneſs, and being deſtitute of houſing and ſhelter, and lying up and down in Booths, ſome of them languiſhed and died: yea, it pleaſed God to take away amongſt the reſt, that bleſſed Servant of Chriſt Mr. <hi>Iſaac Johnſon,</hi> with his Lady, ſoon after their arrival, with ſundry other precious Saints. This ſickneſs being heavy upon them, cauſed the principal of them to propoſe to the reſt to ſet a day apart to ſeek the Lord for the aſſwaging of his diſpleaſure therein, as alſo for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and guidance in the ſolemn enterprize of entring into Church-fellowſhip; which ſolemn day of Humiliation was obſerved by all, not onely of themſelves, but alſo by their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96779:48"/>
Brethren at <hi>Plimouth</hi> in their behalf: and the Lord was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated not onely to aſſwage the ſickneſs, but alſo encouraged their hearts to a beginning, and in ſome ſhort time after to a further progreſs in the great Work of Erecting a way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Chriſt in Church-fellowſhip, according to Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inſtitution. Thoſe choice and eminent Servants of Chriſt did not deſpiſe their poor Leaders and Fellow-ſouldiers that they found in the ſame Work of the Lord with them at <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> but treated them as Brethren, much pitying their great ſtraits and hardſhips they had endured in the firſt beginning of Planting this Wilderneſs, promiſing all helpfulneſs even out of their own Eſtates according to their power; and their ſaid Brethren at <hi>Plimouth</hi> were perſwaded they ſpake as they thought in their hearts: for, ſuch was the ſimplicity of thoſe times, as that divers faces were not carried under a hood; Pride, Covetouſneſs, Profaneneſs, and ſinful Self, were aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ſeen, except in obſcure places and perſons. Oh poor <hi>New-England,</hi> conſider what thou waſt, and what thou now art! <hi>Repent, and do thy firſt works,</hi> ſaith the Lord; ſo may <hi>thy peace yet be as a river,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa 48.18, 19.</note>

               <p>The firſt that began in the work of the Lord above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, were their honoured Governour Mr. <hi>John Winthrop,</hi> Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> fore-named, that much honoured Gentleman Mr. <hi>Thomas Dudley,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Wilſon</hi> aforeſaid: Theſe four were the firſt that began that honourable Church of <hi>Boſton,</hi> unto whom there joyned many others. The ſame year alſo Mr. <hi>George Philips</hi> (who was a worthy Servant of Chriſt, and Diſpenſer of his Word) began a Church-fellowſhip at <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town;</hi> as did alſo Mr. <hi>Maverick</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wareham</hi> at <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> the ſame year.</p>

               <p>THis year one Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Gardiner</hi> (being as himſelf ſaid) deſcended of the houſe of <hi>Gardiner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> who was ſo great a Perſecutor of Gods Saints in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, arrived in <hi>New-England;</hi> he being a great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller received his firſt honor of Knight-hood at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made Knight at the Sepulchre there: he came into theſe parts in pretence of forſaking the World, and to live a private life in a godly courſe, not unwilling to put himſelf upon any mean imployment, and take any pains for his living, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times offered himſelf to joyn to the Church in ſundry places: he brought over with him a ſervant or two, and a comely young woman whom he called his Couſin; but it was ſuſpected (that after the <hi>Italian</hi> manner) ſhe was his Concubine: he living at the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> for ſome miſcarriages for which he ſhould have anſwered, fled away from Authority and got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Indians in the Jurisdiction of <hi>New-Plimouth;</hi> the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> ſent after him but could not get him, and promiſed ſome reward to thoſe that ſhould finde him; the <hi>Indians</hi> came to the Governour of <hi>Plimouth</hi> and told where he was, and asked if they might kill him, but the ſaid Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour told them no, they ſhould not kill him by no means, but if they could take him alive and bring him to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> they ſhould be payed for their pains; they ſaid he had a Gun and a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96779:49"/>
Rapier, and he would kill them if they went about it, and the <hi>Maſſachuſets Indians</hi> ſaid they might kill him, but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour aforeſaid told them no, they ſhould not kill him, but watch their opportunity and take him, and ſo they did; for when they light on him by a River ſide, he got into a Cannoo to get from them, and when they came near him, whiles he preſented his piece at them to keep them off, the ſtream carried the Cannoo againſt a Rock, and threw both him and his Piece and the Rapier into the water, yet he got out, and having a little dagger by his ſide, they durſt not cloſe with him; but getting long poles, they ſoon beat his dagger out of his hand: ſo he was glad to yield, and they brought him to the Governour at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> but his hands and arms were ſwelled and very ſore with the blows they had given him, ſo he uſed him kindly, and ſent him to a lodging where his arms were bathed and annointed, and he was quickly well again, and blamed the <hi>Indians</hi> for beating him ſo much: they ſaid they did but a little whip him with ſticks. In his lodging thoſe that made his bed, found a little Note-book that by accident had ſlipped out of his pocket or ſome private place, in which was a memorial what day he was reconciled to the <hi>Pope</hi> and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in what Univerſity he took his <hi>Scapula,</hi> and ſuch and ſuch a Degree; it being brought to the Governour, he kept it, and ſent it to the Governour of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> with word of his taking, who ſent for him; but afterwards he went for <hi>England</hi> and ſhewed his malice againſt <hi>New-England,</hi> but God prevented him; of which I thought meet to inſert a Letter from Mr. <hi>Winthrop</hi> Governour of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> to Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> the Governour of <hi>Plimouth</hi> (in reference to this matter) as alſo the Copy of an Order rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the ſame as followeth.

               <p>The Plantation of <hi>Plimouth</hi> having had ſome former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as hath been hinted, they ſeeing them ſeated in a barren quarter, told them of a River called by them <hi>the Freſh River,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Which is the ſame called <hi>Conecticot River.</hi>
                  </note> which they often commended unto them for a good place, both for Plantation and Trade, and wiſhed them to make uſe of it; but their hands being full otherwiſe, they let it paſs: but afterwards there coming a company of <hi>Indians</hi> into theſe parts, that were driven out of their Country by the potency of the <hi>Pequots,</hi> they ſollicited them to go thither. Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> not ſeeing them very forward to entertain the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they moved with great ardency, they ſollicited them of the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> in like ſort; but they being then not fit to entertain the motion, in reſpect that they were newly come into the Country, did not much regard
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96779:51"/>
it. Notwithſtanding, ſome of the chief made a motion to joyn with ſome here in a way of Trade at the ſame River; on which a meeting was appointed to treat concerning the ſame matter, and ſome of <hi>Plimouth</hi> appointed to give them meeting, which they did, but they caſt in the way many fears of danger and loſs, and the like, on which they of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the thing, and did not proceed therein. Whereupon, thoſe of <hi>Plimouth</hi> went on alone, and prepared a Frame of an Houſe, and ſtowed it into a Barque, ready to rear at their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and went up the ſaid River, and reared their Houſe, and fenced it about with a Palliſado, which was done with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, not onely of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, the place they poſſeſſed themſelves of, was ſuch as the <hi>Dutch</hi> had nothing to do with, and likewiſe was lawfully purchaſed of the <hi>Indians</hi> which they carried with them. And this was <hi>Plimouths</hi> entrance there, who deſerved to have held it, and not by friends to have been thruſt out, as in a ſort they afterwards were.</p>
               <p>This year it pleaſed God to viſit <hi>Plimouth</hi> with an infectious Feaver, of which many fell very ſick, and upwards of twenty died, men, women and children, and ſundry of them were of their ancient Friends; amongſt the reſt, Mr. <hi>Samuel Fuller</hi> then died, after he had much helped others, and was a comfort to them: he was their Chirurgion and Phyſician, and did much good in his place, being not onely uſefull in his faculty, but otherwiſe as he was a godly man, and ſerved Chriſt in the Office of a Deacon in the Church for many years, and forward to do good in his place, and was much miſſed after God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved him out of this world.</p>
               <p>This ſickneſs cauſed much ſadneſs amongſt them, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their duty they beſought the Lord by Faſting and Prayer, and he was intreated of them, and towards Winter the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ceaſed. This ſickneſs being a kinde of a peſtilent Feaver, ſwept away alſo many of the <hi>Indians</hi> from many places near adjoyning to <hi>Plimouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, That the Spring before this ſickneſs,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96779:51"/>
there was a numerous company of <hi>Flies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted Flies a preſage of a ſickneſs that followed.</note> which were like for bigneſs unto <hi>Waſps</hi> or <hi>Bumble Bees,</hi> they came out of little holes in the ground, and did eat up the green things, and made ſuch a conſtant yelling noiſe as made all the Woods ring of them, and ready to deaf the hearers; they were not any of them heard or ſeen by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Country before this time: but the <hi>Indians</hi> told them that ſickneſs would follow, and ſo it did very hot in the Months of <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> of that Summer.</p>
               <p>This year there arrived in <hi>New-England</hi> thoſe three worthy Inſtruments, Mr. <hi>John Cotton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi>

               <p>This Year one Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> who had ſometimes lived at <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-India's,</hi> came into theſe parts; of whom I have nothing to ſpeak in way of commendation, but rather the contrary. After he had been to and fro in the Country, he returned towards <hi>Virginia</hi> with one Captain <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> and ſo it was, that as they returned they went in at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticot</hi> River, where the <hi>Indians</hi> killed the ſaid <hi>Stone</hi> as he lay in his Cabbin, and threw a Covering over him: they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96779:52"/>
killed all the reſt of his Company but the ſaid Captain <hi>Norton,</hi> he defending himſelf a long time in the Cook-room of the Barque, untill by accident the Gunpowder took fire, which for readineſs he had ſet in an open thing before him, which did ſo burn and ſcald him, and blinde his eyes, as he could make no longer reſiſtance, but was ſlain alſo by them, and they made a prey of his goods.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, That the ſaid <hi>Stone</hi> being at the <hi>Dutch</hi> Plantation in the fore-part of this year, a certain Barque of <hi>Plimouth</hi> being there likewiſe on Trading, he kept company with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Governour, and made him drunk, and got leave of him in his drunkenneſs to take the ſaid Barque, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any occaſion or cauſe given him; and ſo taking his time when the Merchant and ſome of the chief of the men were on ſhore, with ſome of his own men, made the reſt of them weigh Anchor, and ſet ſail to carry her away to <hi>Virginia:</hi> but ſome of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Seamen, who had been at <hi>Plimouth</hi> and received kindneſs, ſeeing this horrible abuſe, got a Veſſel or two and purſued them, and brought them back. After this he came into the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Bay, where they commenced Suit againſt him; but by the mediation of ſome it was taken up, and afterwards in the company of ſome Gentlemen he came to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and was kindly entertained: but Revenge boiling in his breaſt, (as ſome conceived) he watched a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have ſtabbed the Governour, and put his hand to his Dagger for that end, but by Gods Providence ordering the vigilance of ſome that were about him, he was prevented: but God met with him for theſe and other wickedneſſes, as hath been before related.</p>

               <p>This Year Mr. <hi>Edward Winſlow</hi> took a Voyage for <hi>England,</hi> on publick occaſions, and it came to paſs that he had occaſion to anſwer ſome Complaints made againſt the Country, at the Council Board; more chiefly concerning the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Jurisdiction, which he did to good effect, and further proſecuted ſuch things as might tend to the good of the whole: in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular he preferred a Petition to the Right Honourable the Lords Commiſſioners for the Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto ſome injuries done by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> unto the Country; which Petition found good acceptance, and was in a way to a ſatisfactory Anſwer: but ſundry Adverſaries interpoſed, whoſe ends were the ſubverſion and overthrow of the Churches, at leaſt to diſturb their peace, and hinder their growth; but by Gods providence it ſo fell out in the end, that although thoſe Adverſaries croſſed the Petition for taking any further effect in the end principally intended in it; yet by this as a means, the whole plot was diſcovered, and thoſe Adverſaries came to nothing: the particulars whereof, are too long here to be inſerted.</p>
               <p>This Year, on Saturday, the fifteenth day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> was ſuch a mighty ſtorm of Wind and Rain, as none now living in

                  <note place="margin">The great ſtorm or Hirracane</note> It began in the morning a little before day, and grew not by degrees, but came with great violence in the beginning, to the great amazement of many; It blew down ſundry houſes, and uncovered divers others: divers Veſſels were loſt at Sea in it, and many more in extream danger. It cauſed the Sea to ſwell in ſome places to the ſouthward of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> as that it aroſe to twenty foot right up and down, and made many of the <hi>Indians</hi> to climb into Trees for their ſafety: It threw down all the Corn to the ground, which never roſe more; the which through the mercy of God, it being near harveſt time, was not loſt, though much the worſe: and had the wind continued without ſhifting, in likelihood it would have drowned ſome part of the Country. It blew down many hundred thouſands of Trees, turning up the ſtronger by the roots, and breaking the high Pine Trees and ſuch like in the midſt, and the tall young Oaks, and Walnut Trees of good bigneſs, were wound as a Wyth by it; very ſtrange and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to behold: It began in the Southeaſt, and veered ſundry wayes, but the greateſt force of it at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> was from the former quarter, it continued not in extremity above five or ſix hours, ere the violence of it began to abate; the marks of it will remain this many years, in thoſe parts where it was ſoreſt: the Moon ſuffered a great Eclipſe two nights after it.</p>

               <head>1637.</head>
               <p>IN the fore-part of this Year, the <hi>Pequots</hi> fell openly upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Connecticot,</hi> in the lower parts of the River, and ſlew ſundry of them as they were at work in the fields, both men and women, to the great terror of the reſt; and went away in great pride and triumph with many high threats: they alſo aſſaulted <hi>Saybrock</hi> Fort, at the mouth of the River of <hi>Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticot,</hi> although it was ſtrong and well defended: it ſtruck them with much fear and aſtoniſhment, to ſee their bold attempts in the face of danger, which made them in all places to ſtand upon their guard, and to prepare for reſiſtance, and earneſtly to ſolicite their friends and confederates in the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Bay, to ſend them ſpeedy aid, for they looked for more forceable aſſaults: Mr. <hi>Vane</hi> being then Governour of that Juriſdiction, writ from their General Court to the Governour and Court of <hi>New-Plimouth,</hi> to joyn with them in this War, to which they were cordially willing: In the mean time, before things could be prepared for to ſet out, the <hi>Pequots</hi> (as they had done the winter before) ſought to make peace with the <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſets,</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:96779:56"/>
and uſed many pernitious Arguments to move them thereunto, as <hi>That the</hi> Engliſh <hi>were ſtrangers, and began to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread their Country, and would deprive them thereof in time, if they were ſuffered to grow and increaſe; and if the</hi> Narrhaganſets <hi>did aſſiſt the</hi> Engliſh <hi>to ſubdue them, that did but make way for their own overthrow; for if they were rooted out, the</hi> Engliſh <hi>would ſoon take occaſion to ſubjugate them; and if they would hearken to them, they ſhould not need to fear the ſtrength of the</hi> Engliſh: <hi>for they would not come to open Battel with them, but fire their Houſes, kill their Cattel, and lye in ambuſh for them as they went abroad upon their occaſions; and all this they might eaſily do with little danger to themſelves: the which courſe being held, they well ſaw the</hi> Engliſh <hi>would not long ſubſiſt, but they would either be ſtarved with hunger, or forced to forſake the Country:</hi> with many like things; inſomuch that the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> were once wavering, and were half minded to have made peace with them, and joyned againſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but again when they conſidered how much wrong they had received from the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quots,</hi> and what an opportunity they now had by helping the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to right themſelves, revenge was ſo ſweet to them, as it prevailed above all the reſt; ſo as they reſolved to joyn with with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> againſt them, and ſo did. The Court of <hi>Plimouth</hi> agreed to ſend fifty men at their own charge, and with as much ſpeed as poſſibly they could get them in a readineſs, under ſufficient Leaders, and provided a Barque to carry their proviſions, and to tend upon them on all occaſions, and when they were ready to march with a ſupply from the Bay, they had word ſent them to ſtay, for the Enemy was as good as van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed and there would be no need.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not take upon me exactly to deſcribe their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this War, becauſe poſſibly it hath been done by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that were Actors therein, and beſt knew the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of things: I ſhall therefore ſet them down in the main and general, according to my beſt Intelligence.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Conecticot,</hi> who were moſt ſenſible of the hurt ſuſtained and the preſent danger, they ſet out a party of men,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96779:56"/>
and another party met them from the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Bay at the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> who were to joyn with them. The <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſets</hi> were very earneſt to be gone, before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were well reſted and refreſhed, eſpecially ſome of them which came laſt: It ſhould ſeem their deſire was to come upon the Enemy ſuddenly and unexpectedly. There being a Barque of <hi>Plimouth</hi> newly put in there, which was come from <hi>Conecticot,</hi> they did encourage them to lay hold of the opportunity of the <hi>Indians</hi> forwardneſs, and to ſhew as great forwardneſs as they, for it would encourage them, and Expedition might turn to their great advantage: So they went on, and ſo ordered their march, as the <hi>Indians</hi> brought them to the Fort of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (in which moſt of their chief men were) before day: They approached the ſame with great ſilence, and ſurrounded it both with <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> that they might not break out, and ſo aſſaulted them with great Courage, ſhooting amongſt them, and entred the Fort with great ſpeed; and thoſe that firſt entred found ſharp reſiſtance from the Enemy, who both ſhot and grapled with them: Others ran into their houſes, and brought out fire and ſet them on fire, which ſoon took in their Mats, and their houſes ſtanding cloſe together, with the wind all was ſoon on a flame, and thereby more were burnt to death then were otherwiſe ſlain. It burnt their Bow-ſtrings, and made them unſerviceable. Thoſe that eſcaped the Fire were ſlain with the Sword; ſome hewed to pieces, others run through with their Rapiers, ſo as they were quickly diſpatched, and very few eſcaped: The Number they thus deſtroyed, was conceived to be above Four hundred. At this time is was a fearful ſight to ſee them thus frying in the Fire, and the ſtreams of Blood quenching the ſame; and horrible was the ſtink and ſcent thereof: but the Victory ſeemed a ſweet Sacrifice, and they gave the praiſe thereof to God,<note place="margin">They praiſe God for giving them the victory</note> who had wrought ſo wonderfully for them, thus to encloſe their Enemies in their hands, and give them ſo ſpeedy Victory over ſo proud, inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and blaſphemous an Enemy. The <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> all this while ſtood round about a loof off from all danger, and left
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96779:57"/>
the whole Execution to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> except it were the ſtopping any that brake away, inſulting over their Enemies in their ruines and miſery, when they ſaw them dancing in the Fire; calling by a word in their own Language, ſignifying <hi>O brave Pequots!</hi> which they uſed familiarly amongſt themſelves in their own praiſes, in Songs of Triumph after their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>After this Service was thus happily accompliſhed, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> marched to the water-ſide, where they met with ſome of their Veſſels, by whom they were refreſhed, and ſupplied with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals and other Neceſſaries: But in their march, the reſt of the <hi>Pequots</hi> drew into a Body, and followed them, thinking to have ſome advantage againſt them by reaſon of a Neck of Land; but when they ſaw the <hi>Engliſh</hi> prepare for them, they kept aloof, ſo as they neither did hurt, nor would receive any. And after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> their refreſhing, and repairing together for further Counſel and Directions, they reſolved to purſue their Victory, and follow the War againſt the reſt: but the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> moſt of them forſook them, and ſuch of them as they had with them for Guides or otherwiſe, they found very cold or backward in the buſineſs, either out of envy, or that they thought the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would make more profit of the Victory then they were willing they ſhould, or elſe deprive them of that advantage that they deſired, in making the <hi>Pequots</hi> become Tributaries unto them, or the like.</p>
               <p>For the reſt of this Tragedy, I ſhall onely relate the ſame as it is in a Letter from Mr. <hi>Winthrop</hi> to Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> as followeth:

About four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore of our men having coaſted along towards the <hi>Dutch</hi> Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſometimes by water, but moſt by land, met here and there with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96779:57"/>
ſome <hi>Pequots,</hi> whom they ſlew or took Priſoners.

Our Captains were not then come together, but there was Mr. <hi>Ludlow</hi> and Captain <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> with ſome ten of their men, and Captain <hi>Patrick</hi> with ſome twenty or more of his, who ſhooting at the <hi>Indians,</hi> Captain <hi>Trask</hi> with fifty more came ſoon in at the noiſe. Then they gave order to ſurround the Swamp, it being about a Mile round; but Lieutenant <hi>Davenport</hi> and ſome twelve more, not hearing that Command, fell into the Swamp amongſt the <hi>Indians:</hi> The Swamp was ſo thick with ſhrubs, and Boggie withall, that ſome ſtuck faſt, and received many ſhot. Lieutenant <hi>Davenport</hi> was dangerouſly wounded about his Arm-hole, and another ſhot in the Head, ſo as fainting they were in great danger to have been taken by the <hi>Indians,</hi> but Sergeant <hi>Riggs</hi> and Sergeant <hi>Jeffery,</hi> and two or three more, reſcued them, and ſlew divers of the <hi>Indians</hi> with their Swords. After they were drawn out, the <hi>Indians</hi> deſired Parley, and were offered by <hi>Thomas Stanton</hi> our Interpreter, That if they would come out and yield themſelves, they ſhould have their lives that had not their hand in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood. Whereupon the <hi>Sachem</hi> of the place came forth, and an old man or two, and their wives and children, and ſo they ſpake two hours, till it was night: Then <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Stanton</hi> was ſent to them again, to call them forth, but they ſaid they would ſell their lives there; and ſo ſhot at him ſo thick, as if he had not been preſently relieved and reſcued on his crying out, they would have ſlain him. Then our men cut off a place of

Swamp with their ſwords, and cooped up the <hi>Indians</hi> into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs, ſo as they could eaſier kill them through the thickets: ſo they continued all the night, ſtanding about twelve foot one from another, and the <hi>Indians</hi> coming up cloſe to our men, ſhot their Arrows ſo thick, as they pierced their Hat brims, and their ſleeves and ſtockens, and other parts of their Clothes, yet ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly did the Lord preſerve them, as not one of them was wounded, ſave thoſe three who raſhly went into the Swamp as aforeſaid. When it was near day it grew very dark, ſo as thoſe of them that were left, dropped away, though they ſtood but twelve or fourteen foot aſunder, and were preſently diſcovered, and ſome killed in the purſuit. In the ſearching of the Swamp the next morning, they found nine ſlain, and ſome they pulled up, whom the <hi>Indians</hi> had buried in the Mire: ſo as they do think that of all this Company not twenty did eſcape, for they after found ſome who died in the flight of their wounds received. The Priſoners were divided, ſome to thoſe of the <hi>River,</hi> and the reſt to us of theſe parts. We ſend the Male-children to <hi>Bermuda</hi>'s by Mr. <hi>William Pierce,</hi> and the Women and Maid-children are diſpoſed about in the Towns. There have been now ſlain and taken in all, about Seven hundred, the reſt are diſperſed, and the <hi>Indians</hi> in all quarters ſo terrified, as all their friends are afraid to receive them. Two of the <hi>Sachems</hi> of <hi>Long-Iſland</hi> came to Mr. <hi>Staughton,</hi> and tendred themſelves to be under our Protection; and two of the <hi>Nepannet Sachems</hi> have been with me to ſeek our Friendſhip. Among the Priſoners we have the Wife and Children of <hi>Mononotto,</hi> a woman of a very modeſt countenance and behaviour: It was by her mediation that the two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maids were ſpared from death, and were kindly uſed by her; ſo that I have taken charge of her. One of her firſt requeſts was, <hi>That the</hi> Engliſh <hi>would not abuſe her body, and that her Children might not be taken from her.</hi> Thoſe which were wounded we fetched ſoon off by <hi>John Gallop,</hi> who came with his Boat in an happy hour to bring them Victuals, and to carry their wounded men to the Barque, where our chief Chirurgion was, with Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> being about eight leagues off. Our people are all in health, the Lord be praiſed: And although they had marched

By ſuch Arguments was the Government of <hi>Plimouth</hi> moved by the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> to do Juſtice in the caſe. And here may be noted, That the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> refuſed this Tryal, as being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Juriſdiction of <hi>Plimouth;</hi> and they of <hi>Road-Iſland</hi> having Apprehended them, delivered them to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Juriſdiction of <hi>Plimouth</hi> on the ſame grounds.</p>
               <p>This Year, about the ſecond of <hi>June,</hi> there was a great and fearful Earthquake: It was heard before it came with a rumbling Noiſe, or low murmure, like unto remote Thunder. It came from the Northwards, and paſſed Southwards: as the Noiſe approached near, the Earth began to quake; and it came at length with that violence, as cauſed Platters, Diſhes,

and ſuch like things which ſtood upon Shelves, to clatter and fall down; yea, people were afraid of their Houſes: and it was ſo, as that ſome being without doors could not ſtand, but were fain to catch hold of Poſts and Pales to prevent them from falling. About half an hour after, or leſs, came another Noiſe and ſhaking, but not ſo loud nor ſtrong as the former. It was not onely on the Land, but at Sea alſo; for ſome Ships that were on the Sea-coaſt were ſhaken by it: ſo powerful is the mighty hand of the Lord, as to cauſe both <hi>the Earth and Sea to ſhake,</hi>

               <p>Saith he, <hi>My dear Friend Mr.</hi> William Brewſter <hi>was a man that had done and ſuffered much for the Lord Jeſus, and the Goſpels ſake, and hath born his part in weal and woe, with this poor perſecuted Church, above thirty ſix years, in</hi> England, Holland, <hi>and in this</hi> Wilderneſs; <hi>and done the Lord and them faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in his place and calling: and notwithſtanding the many troubles and ſorrows he paſſed through, the Lord upheld him to a great age; he was four ſcore and four years of age when he died;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The dea h of Mr. <hi>William Brewſter.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>he had this bleſſing added by the Lord to all the reſt, to dye in his bed in peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the midſt of his friends, who mourned and wept over him, and miniſtred what help and comfort they could unto him; and he again recompenſed them whiles he could: his ſickneſs was not long, and until the laſt day thereof, he did not wholly keep his bed, his ſpeech continued until ſomewhat more then half a day before his death, and then failed him, and about nine or ten of the clock that evening he died without any pangs at all; a few hours before, he drew his breath ſhort, and ſome few minutes before his laſt, he drew his breath long, as a man fallen into a ſound ſleep, without any pangs or gaſping, and ſo ſweetly departed this life unto a better.</hi>

               <p>And here I might take occaſion to mention with admiration, the marvellous providence of God, that notwithſtanding the many changes and hardſhips that this people, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at <hi>New-Plimouth</hi> went through, and the many Enemies they had, and difficulties they met withal, that ſo many of them ſhould live until very old age: It was not only this Reverend mans condition, but many more of them did the like; ſome dying before and about this time, and ſome living, who attained to ſixty years of age, and to ſixty five, divers to ſeventy, and ſome to more then eighty as he did: It muſt needs be more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and above natural reaſon that ſo it ſhould be; for it is found in experience, that changing of Air, Famine, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome Food, much drinking of Water, Sorrows and Troubles <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all of them are enemies to health, cauſes of much diſeaſes, conſumers of natural vigor, and the bodies of men, and ſhortners of life; and yet of all theſe things they had a large and long part, and ſuffered deeply in the ſame:

               <p>About the middle of <hi>May</hi> this Year, there came three Men of War into <hi>Plimouth Harbour,</hi> under the command of Captain <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> who had taken ſeveral Prizes from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by Commiſſion from the Earl of <hi>VVarwick:</hi> they were full of monies, ſilks, and other rich goods, ſome of which they left behinde them. They were a company of luſty ſtout men, but very unruly and hard to govern; notwithſtanding the care and vigilance, both of ſuch as were in Authority of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and alſo of their own Commanders, who could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtrain them, eſpecially from inordinate drinking and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling: It proved fatal to one of them, who being quarrelling with one of their own company, and being commanded by their Captain to forbear, he giving very provoking Language, and alſo attempting to draw upon his Captain, he took his Rapier from him, and ſtruck him on the head, with the Hilt, of which wound, three or four dayes after he died: the Captain was tried by a Council of War, and acquitted by the largeneſs of his Commiſſion.</p>

diſturb, if not innovate their Government, by laying many ſcandals upon them, and intended to proſecute againſt them in <hi>England,</hi> by Petitioning and Complaining to the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Alſo <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> and his company, made complaint againſt them; ſo as they made choice of Mr. <hi>VVinſlow</hi> to be their Agent to make their defence, and gave him Commiſſion and Inſtructions for that end: in which he ſo carried himſelf, as did well anſwer their ends, and cleared them from any blame and diſhonour, to the ſhame of their Adverſaries. After this he fell upon other imployments in <hi>England,</hi> which detained him there, ſo as he returned not again to <hi>New-England</hi> any more, whoſe abſence hath been much to the weakening of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-Plimouth,</hi> who had large experience of his help and uſefulneſs amongſt them in Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of whom I have more to inſert in honour of ſo worthy a Gentleman in its more proper place.</p>

(2) Order. (3) the People. (4) Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; the ſupream virtues of a good Magiſtrate. 1. His love to Juſtice appeared at all times, and in ſpecial upon the Judgement ſeat, without reſpect of perſons in Judgement: and in his own particular tranſactions, with all men he was exact and exemplary. 2. His zeal to Order appeared in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving good Laws, and faithfully executing them upon criminal offenders, Hereticks, and Underminers of true Religion. He had a piercing Judgement to diſcover the Wolf, though cloathed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96779:76"/>
with a ſheep-skin. 3. His love to the People was evident in ſerving them in a publick capacity many Years, at his own coſt, and that as a nurſing Father to the Churches of Chriſt. 4. He loved the true Chriſtian Religion, and the pure Worſhip of God, and cheriſhed as in his boſom, all godly Miniſters and Chriſtians: he was exact in the practice of Piety, in his perſon and family all his life; in a word, he lived deſired, and died lamented by all good men.</p>
               <p>The Verſes following were found in his Pocket after his death, which may further illuſtrate his Character, and give a taſte of his poetical fancy: wherein (it is ſaid) he did excel.</p>

He procured liberty of the Biſhop to viſit his Wife, before her death, and commended her to God by Prayer, who ſoon after gave up the ghoſt: at his return to Priſon, his poor Children being many, repaired to the Biſhop to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and made known unto him their miſerable condition, by reaſon of their good Father his being continued in cloſe durance; who commiſerated their condition ſo far, as to grant him his liberty, who ſoon after came over into <hi>New-England,</hi> and ſetled for ſome time at the Town of <hi>Scituate,</hi> and was choſen Paſtour of their Church, and faithfully diſpenſed the Word of God amongſt them: and afterwards the ſaid Church dividing, a part whereof removing to <hi>Barnſtable,</hi> he removed with them, and there remained until his death. He was a man of an humble and broken heart and ſpirit, lively in diſpenſation of the Word of God; ſtudious of peace, furniſhed with godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; willing to ſpend and to be ſpent for the Cauſe and Church of Chriſt. He fell aſleep in the Lord, <hi>Nov.</hi> 8. 1653.</p>

               <p>This Worthy Gentleman was interred with the greateſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities that the Juriſdiction to which he belonged was in a capacity to perform: many deep ſighs, as well as loud volleys of ſhot, declaring that the People were no leſs ſenſible of their own loſs, who were ſurviving, then mindful of the worth and honour of him that was deceaſed; you might now eaſily diſcern a heavy heart in the mournful countenance of every ſober minded and conſiderate man: for as you have heard in the three or four Years laſt paſt, God was pleaſed greatly to weaken this poor tottering Colony of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> by taking away ſeveral of the moſt uſefull Props thereof, both in Church and Civil State; ſome others who had been of ſingular uſe, now ſtooping under the infirmities of old age, could not be ſo ſerviceable as in times paſt, and others removed ſo far from the center of the Government, that they could not without great difficulties attend their publick concerns, nor could poſſibly ſo conſtantly as our neceſſities required, which did greatly aggravate our troubles: we were become weak, when we had need of greateſt ſtrength; had loſt many of our Chieftains, when we ſtood in need of the beſt conduct and guidance: for beſides the troubles and changes that then attended our Native Country, and might call for great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection in our walking in relation unto them; we had alſo at this very time, ſome amongſt us that growing weary of the long peace and concord that we had enjoyed, and hoping to fiſh better in troubled waters, when their bait might be taken in, and the hook not eaſily diſcerned, would willingly have been

ringing the Changes in this Juriſdiction alſo, pretending a great zeal for liberty of Conſcience, but endeavouring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce ſuch a liberty of Will, as would have proved prejudicial, if not deſtructive to Civil and Church ſocieties: and at the ſame time there arrived in the ſaid Colony many of that pernicious ſect called <hi>Quakers,</hi> whoſe Opinion are a compoſition of many errors, and whoſe practices tend greatly to the diſturbance both of Church and State; many unſtable people amongſt us were leavened with their errors, and proved very troubleſome to this as well as other Colonies in <hi>New-England.</hi> But the Lord many times delighteth to appear in the Mount of his Peoples miſeries, diſtreſſes and troubles, that his power and wiſdom may appear when they are weakeſt, and that they may know that their ſalvation is from him. At ſuch a time, &amp; when the condition of this Colony was ſuch as hath been declared, God was pleaſed to minde it, even in its low eſtate, and when he had taken to himſelf not only our <hi>Moſes,</hi> but many of the Elders and Worthies of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he hath not hitherto left us without a <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> to lead us in the remaining part of our pilgrimage.

by Office a Deacon of the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Plimouth</hi>) and in other reſpects very officious as occaſion did require. He having a great Temporal Eſtate, was occaſioned thereby to have abundance of buſineſs upon him: but when he was to put off this his earthly Tabernacle, he laid aſide all his earthly Incumbrances and Occaſions, even as one would have taken off a garment, and laid it down; and without any trouble of Spirit (on that behalf) prepared himſelf for his Journey to the Everlaſting Manſions, prepared for him by his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the higheſt Heavens, whereof he was well aſſured; as to the like effect he ſpake ſome words to Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> near unto the period of his life: and ſo falling aſleep in the Lord, he was buried at <hi>Boſton</hi> with honour and great lamentation, in the year and moneth above-mentioned.</p>

               <p>Having noted before, That in the Year 1657. there arrived in the Colony of <hi>New-Plimouth</hi> many of that pernicious Sect called <hi>Quakers,</hi> the Reader may take notice, That by this time, and for ſome years after, <hi>New-England</hi> (in divers parts of it) abounded with them, and they ſowed their corrupt and damnable Doctrines, both by word and writings, almoſt in every Town of each Juriſdiction; ſome whereof were, <hi>That all men ought to attend to the Light within them to be the Rule of their Lives and Actions;</hi> and, <hi>That the holy Scriptures were not for the inlightning of man, nor a ſetled and permanent Rule of life.</hi> They denied the Manhood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and affirmed, <hi>That as Man he is not in Heaven.</hi> They denied the Reſurrection from the dead. They affirmed, <hi>That an abſolute Perfection in Holineſs or Grace is attainable in this life.</hi> They placed their Juſtification upon their Patience and Suffering for their Opinions, and on their righteous life, and retired demu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and affected ſingularity both in word and geſture.</p>
               <p>As to Civil account, they allowed not nor practiſed any civil reſpect to man, though ſuperiours, either in Magiſtratical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, or as Maſters, or Parents, or the Ancient, neither by word nor geſture. They deny alſo the uſe of Oathes for
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96779:85"/>
the deciding of Civil Controverſies; with other abominable Opinions, Dreams, and Conceits, which ſome of them have expreſſed, tending to groſs Blaſphemy and Atheiſm.</p>
               <p>This efficacy of Deluſion became very prevalent with many, ſo as the number of them increaſed, to the great endangering of the ſubverſion of the whole, both of Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, notwithſtanding the endeavours of thoſe in Authority to ſuppreſs the ſame, had not the Lord declared againſt them, by blaſting their Enterprizes &amp; Contrivements, ſo as they have of late withered away in a great meaſure; ſundry of their Teachers and Leaders which have cauſed them to erre, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the Country, and we truſt the Lord will make the folly of the remainder manifeſt to all men more and more. Errour is not long-lived; the day will declare it. Let our deliverance from ſo eminent a danger, be received amongſt the principal of the Lords gracious Providences, and merciful loving kindneſſes towards <hi>New-England;</hi> for the which let preſent and future generations celebrate his Praiſes.</p>
               <p>This year that Learned and godly Servant of God, Mr. <hi>Henry Dunſter,</hi> fell aſleep in the Lord. He was ſometimes Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of <hi>Harvard</hi> Colledge at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> in which he approved himſelf to the ſatisfaction of ſuch as were in thoſe Affairs concerned. Afterwards he came into the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of <hi>New-Plimouth,</hi> and lived awhile in the Town of <hi>Scituate,</hi> and was uſeful in helping to oppoſe the abominable Opinions of the <hi>Quakers</hi> fore-mentioned, and in the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Truth againſt them. He deceaſing in the ſaid Town of <hi>Scituate,</hi> his Body was embalmed, and removed unto <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> aforeſaid, and there honourably buried.</p>

               <p>This year, on the 26 of <hi>January,</hi> at the ſhutting in of the Evening, there was a very great Earthquake in <hi>New-England,</hi> and the ſame night another, although ſomething leſs then the former.</p>
               <p>And again, on the 28 of the ſame moneth there was another about Nine of the clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch as I have had ſpecial occaſion ſeveral times in this Hiſtory to mention divers Earthquakes that have been in <hi>New-England,</hi> they being great and terrible works of God, and are uſually ominous to ſome; ſtrokes and viſitations of his hand unto places and peoples where they are; and ſometimes the Lord in the very acting of his power in them, hath declared his ſeverity to the children of men, to their great overthrow and confuſion:</p>
               <p>I thought it neceſſary, before I paſs on, a little to point at ſome few particulars, to work and induce us to a profitable remembrance of them; it being very conſiderable that is ſaid by a uſeful Author, in taking notice of the Wiſdome of God, in preparing the Earth to be a fit Habitation for man to dwell in, addeth withall, <hi>That as if man were not alwayes worthy to tread upon ſo ſolid a foundation, we ſee it oft-times quake and ſhake, and rock and rend it ſelf, as if it ſhewed that he which made it threatned by this trembling the Impiety of the world, and the ruine of thoſe that dwell on the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order unto that which I have nominated in this behalf, and more principally intend, let us take notice, That Writers have rendred the cauſe of Earthquakes to be, <hi>That when it
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96779:87"/>
happeneth that Air and windy Spirits and Exhalations are ſhut up in the Caverns of the Earth, or have ſuch paſſage as is too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for them, they then ſtriving to break their priſons, ſhake the Earth, and make it tremble.</hi> They ſpeak likewiſe of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kindes of them: as</p>
               <p>Firſt, When the whole force of the Wind driveth to one place, there being no contrary motion to let or hinder it; many Hills and Buildings have been ruſhed down by this kinde of Earthquake, eſpecially when the Wind cauſing it was ſtrong: for if it be a feeble Wind, it onely looſeneth or unfaſteneth Foundations; if leſs feeble, then without further harm the Earth onely ſhakes, like one ſick of an Ague.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſecond kinde is a ſwelling of the Earth; the which, when the Wind is broken out of its priſon, the Earth returns to its place again.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A third kinde is, A gaping, rending, or cleaving of the Earth one part from another, ſo that ſometimes whole Towns, Cities, Rocks, Hills, Rivers, and ſome parts of the Sea hath been ſwallowed up, and never ſeen more.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A fourth kinde is, Shaking that cauſeth ſinking, and is farre different from the former;<note place="margin">Thus was the Atlantick Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an cauſed to be a Sea, as <hi>Plato</hi> affirmeth, who lived <hi>366</hi> years before Chriſt was born.</note> for now the Earth ſplitteth not, but ſinketh: this being in ſuch places where though the ſurface of the ground be ſolid, yet it hath but a ſalt foundation, which being moiſtened by water driven through it by the force of the ſhaking Exhalation, is turned into water alſo.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, A fifth kinde of Earthquake is contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for as before the ground ſinks down, ſo now it is caſt up, like as in the ſecond kinde already mentioned: onely this is the difference, that now it returneth not to its place again, but remains a great Mountain. And note, that if ſuch a Riſing be in the Sea, it not onely cauſeth overflowings, but produceth likewiſe many Iſlands, ſuch as were never ſeen before.</p>
               <p>Theſe particulars are treated of at large by approved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and here onely hinted, to the intent that we may take notice of the ſpecial Providence of God to <hi>New-England</hi> in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96779:87"/>
this behalf, that we have not as yet felt the miſery of the worſt of the kindes of Earthquakes forenamed, nor ſwallowed up in them, but thoſe we have been ſenſible of have been rather gentle Warnings unto us, to ſhake us out of our earthly-mindedneſs, ſpiritual ſecurity, and other ſins, leſt the Lord do come againſt us with Judgements of this kinde in the ſoreſt and worſt ſort of them, or otherwiſe by removing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent bleſſing of godly Government from us.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding that which hath been ſaid, the Efficient Cauſe is Supernatural, as either principally <hi>God,</hi> or inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally the <hi>Angels,</hi> although naturally the Wind ſhut up within the Pores and Bowels of the Earth, as is before-noted.</p>
               <p>If the Effects of them uſually are ſuch,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.18. Pſal. 29 6. &amp; 104.32. Matth. 28.2. Pſal. 18.15. Zech. 14.4. Rev. 6.12, 14. Mat 27 51. Acts 16.25.</note> as by them is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a diſcovery of the Channels of Water, and Foundations of the World, the Removing of Mountains from one place to another, the Cleaving of Rocks, and opening of Graves and of Gates, yea the throwing down of many famous Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Cities, and ſome ſwallowed up, and many thouſands of people deſtroyed thereby; the turning of plain Land into Mountains; the throwing down of Mountains, and raiſing up of Iſlands in the Sea, the breaking out of Rivers where there were none before; the diſcovery of burning Mountains where there were none ſeen before; Famine and Peſtilence: (of which particulars divers inſtances might be produced out of the Sacred Scriptures, and ſeveral other Authors;) Ought we not then to fear and tremble before ſo great a God, who (as one ſaith) <hi>by his Handmaid Nature doth ſo terribly ſhake the Earth, as no Land can be ſure, no place ſo ſtrong that can defend us?</hi> Nay, the more ſtrong, the more dangerous; for, the higher, the greater the fall. Let us therefore ſay with the Wiſe-man,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3 14.</note> 
                  <hi>I know that whatſoever God doth, ſhall ſtand for ever; nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doth it that men ſhould fear before him.</hi>

of ſpirit reſigned himſelf up to the Lord, and his Spirit into arms of his bleſſed Redeemer, deſiring that the holy Angels might do their office in tranſporting his Soul into everlaſting bliſs and happineſs. He fell aſleep in the Lord on the the fifth of <hi>July</hi> 1663.</p>
               <p>This year alſo it pleaſed God to put a ſpeedy period to the life of Mr: <hi>John Norton,</hi> who was <hi>a burning and a ſhining Light;</hi> and although the Church of <hi>Boſton</hi> in a more ſpecial manner felt the ſmart of this ſudden blow, yet it reflected upon the whole Land.

At his firſt coming over into <hi>New-England,</hi> he arrived at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> where he abode the beſt part of one Winter, and Preached the Goſpel of the Kingdome unto them; and ever after to his dying day retained a good affection unto them: From thence he went to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Ipſwich</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> where he was choſen the Teacher of their Church; and after the death of worthy Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> he was ſollicited, and at length obtained to return to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and there ſerved in that Office untill his death.

               <p>This year a <hi>Blazing-Star</hi> or <hi>Comet</hi> appeared in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and the beginning of the Twelfth Moneth: Concerning which, it hath been obſerved, That ſuch was its motion, that in all likelihood it was viſible to all the Inhabitants of the Earth; and that alſo in its motion the <hi>Blaze</hi> of it did turn to all the quarters of the World; and that by its turning according to the ſeveral Aſpects it had to the Sun, it was no fiery Meteor cauſed by Exhalation, but that it was ſent immediately by God to awake the ſecure World.</p>
               <p>I willingly cloſe with that which Mr. <hi>Samuel Danforth</hi> hath Religiouſly obſerved, as to the <hi>Theological Application</hi> of this ſtrange and notable Appearance in the Heavens, <hi>That indeed by the Teſtimony of the Sacred Scriptures, and the common Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of former Ages,</hi> Comets <hi>do uſually precede, and portend great Calamities, and notable Changes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To adde a few more Inſtances to thoſe the ſaid Author hath well obſerved.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour <hi>Jovian</hi> attained to the Empire, (ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Apoſtata <hi>Julian,</hi> under whom the Church ſuffered much Perſecution) and that under him both Church and Commonwealth were like to have had a flouriſhing time, had

                  </note> Then alſo appeared a <hi>Comet,</hi> ſhewing that further trouble was yet to be expected to the Church.</p>
               <p>Again, other Authors make mention of a ſtrange <hi>Comet</hi> that was ſeen in the year of Chriſt 410, being like a Two-edged Sword, which portended many Miſchiefs and Calamities that happened both in the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſuch great ſlaughters of men were about thoſe dayes, as no Age ever afforded the like: All <hi>Europe</hi> was in a manner undone; no ſmall part of <hi>Aſia</hi> was affrighted; and <hi>Africa</hi> alſo was not void of thoſe Evils, as War, Famine, Drought and Peſtilence: all of them ſtrove as it were to trouble the whole World.</p>
               <p>Alſo in the Years 1400, 1401, 1402, 1403, <hi>Comets</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and great Calamities followed; ſundry unheard-of Diſeaſes were felt, Rivers dried up, and Plagues were increaſed;<note place="margin">Reade <hi>Carion, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>pag</hi> 854.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Alſo in the Year 1529 appeared four <hi>Comets;</hi> and in the Years 1530, 1532, and 1533, were ſeen in each year one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lanquet</hi> ſaith, That there were three within the ſpace of two years, upon which theſe and the like Calamities followed; <hi>viz.</hi> A great Sweating Sickneſs in <hi>England,</hi> which took away great multitudes of people; The <hi>Turk</hi> in the quarrel of <hi>John Vnavoyda,</hi> who laid Claim to the Crown of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> entred the ſaid Kingdome with Two hundred and fifty thouſand fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souldiers, committing againſt the Inhabitants thereof moſt harſh and unſpeakable Murthers, Rapes, Villanies and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties.</p>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96779:94"/>
and had the chief Command of thoſe that at the firſt there ſeated, and bare a deep ſhare of the Difficulties of thoſe firſt beginnings, which were great, by reaſon eſpecially of the great Sickneſs and Mortality that was then amongſt them, as hath been before-noted: There he continued, untill the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> ſaw reaſon to deſire his removal to <hi>Boſton,</hi> for the more convenient Adminiſtration of Juſtice, as Governour of the ſaid Juriſdiction, to which he was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Elected for many years together with little intermiſſion; and in which honourable Service he ſerved God and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, untill old Age, and the Infirmities thereof, coming upon him, he fell aſleep in the Lord, and was with great honour and ſolemnity Interred at <hi>Boſton.</hi>

We have likewiſe received intelligence of four more that about that time were ſlain by Thunder and Lightning about <hi>Paſcataqua,</hi> and divers more hurt. At the time of this ſtorm of Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in the which thoſe of <hi>Marſhfield</hi> died, there aroſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a very great Whirlwind, that where it came it tore up Trees by the Roots, though through mercy it did little other hurt.</p>
               <p>It was a great while, and many years ſpent ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:96779:95"/>
came into theſe parts, before any very conſiderable hurt was done by Thunder and Lightning to either man, or beaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to them, although ſometimes very fierce ſtorms of that kinde, as frequently as in theſe times: but now how doth the Lord go on gradually in this, as in other Judgements here in <hi>New-England?</hi> firſt by ſtriking Cattel, and then one perſon at a time, and this year divers, to the number of ſeven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome Cattel alſo.</p>

               <p>This year the Lord threatned the Country with that infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious and contagious Diſeaſe of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> which began at <hi>Boſton,</hi> whereof ſome few died: but through his great mercy it is ſtayed, and none of late have died thereof.</p>
               <p>This year the Lord likewiſe threatned, and in ſome meaſure executed his diſpleaſure upon the Country by Drought; but through his mercy hath of late ſent plenty of Rain, for the recovering of the fruits of the earth. Although it is to be

obſerved, That ſoon after a day of Humiliation was obſerved by ſome Congregations, for the bleſſing of Rain in the Drought above-mentioned, that ſad ſtroke by the Thunder and Lightning at <hi>Marſhfield</hi> fell out: ſo that we may ſay with the Pſalmiſt unto the Lord, <hi>By terrible things in Righteouſneſs thou haſt anſwered us, O God of our Salvation.</hi>

               <p>This year much of the Wheat is deſtroyed with Blaſting and Mildew, as alſo ſome other Grain by Worms, and the Drought aforementioned; but the Lord hath ſent much Rain for the recovery of the remainder, through his great mercy.</p>

               <p>And the Lord was pleaſed to come in unto ſome of them, ſo as they gave good ſatisfaction unto the ſaid honoured and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious perſons forenamed, then aſſembled in reference to the premiſes: So that it was concluded by them, That what had paſſed from the <hi>Indians</hi> in that behalf, ſhould be drawn up in writing, and Copies thereof exhibited to the Churches of the Juriſdiction of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> ſuch of them as are neighbouring near unto them; and if nothing ſhould be then objected, that then in due and convenient time they ſhould be permitted and encouraged to enter into Church-fellowſhip as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Now although I doubt not but the Paſſages of theſe things
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96779:96"/>
will be in due time publiſhed by a better Pen; yet I have made bold here to inſert ſo much as I have been informed of them, in regard that they are the firſt-fruits of the Juriſdiction of <hi>New-Plimouth,</hi> that have come on to ſo good perfection in this kinde.</p>
               <p>This year, in the moneth of <hi>December,</hi> it pleaſed God to take unto himſelf by death that worthy Servant of Chriſt Mr. <hi>William Thompſon,</hi> who was a lively diſpenſer of the Word of God, and very affectionate in the delivery thereof. It pleaſed God to bleſs his Labours to the Converſion of many Souls. He was ſometimes, together with Mr. <hi>Knowles,</hi> ſent unto <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> by the Elders of the Churches of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> being requeſted by a Meſſage ſent by ſome of <hi>Virginia</hi> for ſome help in Preaching Gods Word amongſt them: The fruit and benefit of whoſe Labours therein, ſtill remaineth upon the Souls of ſome eminent in this Land. He was Elected and Ordained to be Paſtor of the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Braintry</hi> in <hi>New-England;</hi> in which Office he ſerved Chriſt many years, untill old Age coming upon him, and the prevailing of his <hi>Melancholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper,</hi> did in a manner wholly diſable him from that Service; and Satan taking advantage thereby, he was under ſad deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and trouble of Spirit: At which time the Reverend El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and others of the aforeſaid Juriſdiction of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets,</hi> were very officious for his Recovery, and in ſenſe of his ſad condition offered up many Prayers to God for him, and in Gods good time they received a gracious anſwer; ſo as in his weakneſs and ſickneſs it pleaſed God to come in unto his Soul, and to remove the Cloud of darkneſs that was upon his Spirit, ſo that with much peace and comfort he fell aſleep in the Lord, and his Body was honourably buried at <hi>Braintry. Mark the upright man, and behold the juſt; for the end of that man is peace.</hi>

               <p>This year on the laſt day of <hi>November,</hi> being the laſt day of the next week, there was heard ſeveral loud Noiſes or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, as if it had been Guns diſcharged in the Air, firſt one diſtinctly, and in a ſhort time as it had been a Volley of Shot diſcharged: It was eſpecially heard and obſerved at <hi>Nantasket,</hi> and related by ſundry of them of good Credit.</p>
               <p>In the Spring following, in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> there appeared a Sign in the Heavens in the form of a Spear, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thicker in the middeſt then at either end, of a whitiſh bright colour; it was ſeen ſeveral nights together in the Weſt, about an hour within the night: it ſtood ſtooping, and the one end pointing to the ſetting of the Sun, and ſo ſetled downward by little and little, untill it quite vaniſhed, and deſcended beneath our Horizon. God awaken us, that we be not heedleſs ſpectators of his wonderful Works.</p>
               <p>This year, on the ſeventh of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> it pleaſed the Lord to call home to himſelf the Reverend, Ancient, and godly Paſtor of the Church of <hi>Boſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Wilſon:</hi> He was a truely Reverend and holy Man of God; he came to <hi>New-England</hi> in the year 1630. He was inſtrumental in the firſt beginnings of the Church of <hi>Boſton,</hi> having been the Paſtor of it three years
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96779:97"/>
before Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> Twenty years with him, Ten years with Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> and Four years after him; Thirty ſeven in all: And in all the Changes of Times that paſſed over him, he was full of Faith and Prayer, and eminent for Sincerity and Humility, (being ever low in his own eyes;) and for the grace of Love, he had <hi>largeneſs of heart as the ſand of the Sea,</hi> to do good to all. He was very charitable, where there was any ſigns and hopes of good; and yet withall very zealous againſt known and manifeſt evils. He was Orthodox in his Judgement, and very holy in his Converſation: Very few that ever went out of the world, ſo generally beloved and reverenced as this good man. He was <hi>a good man</hi> indeed, <hi>and full of the holy Ghoſt;</hi> He lived to <hi>a good old age, and was full of dayes,</hi> and full of honour, being in the Seventy ninth year of his Age, when the Lord took him to himſelf. He was Interred with much Honour and Lamentation.</p>
               <p>In the time of his languiſhing Sickneſs he was viſited by the Elders round about, eſpecially on the Sixteenth of <hi>May,</hi> the day after the Court of Election, when there being a general meeting of all the Elders of the Churches at his houſe, they requeſted Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> (becauſe they knew not whether ever they ſhould have the like opportunity to hear him ſpeak again, and having been from the firſt a Pillar amongſt them, and of much Experience in his obſervation of the ſtate of things) That he would ſolemnly declare to them, what he conceived to be thoſe ſins amongſt us, which provoked the diſpleaſure of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Country. He then told them, <hi>That he had divers times, and long feared theſe ſins following, as chief among others, which God was greatly provoked with;</hi> viz.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Separation.</item>
                  <item>2. Anabaptiſm.</item>
                  <item>3. Corahiſm.</item>
               </list>
               <p>This latter he did explain thus; <hi>viz. when people riſe up, as</hi> Corah, <hi>againſt their Miniſters or Elders, as if they took too much upon them, when indeed they do but Rule for Chriſt, and according to Chriſt; yet</hi> (ſaith he), <hi>it is nothing for a Brother
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96779:98"/>
to ſtand up, and oppoſe without Scripture or Reaſon, the Doctrine and word of the Elder, ſaying,</hi> [I am not ſatisfied] <hi>&amp;c. And hence, if he do not like the Adminiſtration, (be it Baptiſm, or the like) he will then turn his back upon God and his Ordinances, and go away,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for our neglect of baptizing the Children of the Church, thoſe that ſome call</hi> Grandchildren, <hi>I think God is provoked by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Another ſin I take to be, The making light of, and not ſubjecting to the Authority of</hi> Synods, <hi>without which the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches cannot long ſubſiſt. And ſo for the Magiſtrates being</hi> Gallio-<hi>like, either not caring for theſe things, or elſe not uſing their Power and Authority for the maintenance of the Truth, and Goſpel, and Ordinances of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and for the bearing thorough witneſs againſt the contrary: Should the Lord leave</hi> THEM <hi>hereunto, how miſerable a people ſhould we be!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At night the Aſſembly being diſmiſſed with Prayer, Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> did (being deſired by them ſo to do) in a ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bleſs the Elders, making a ſhort Prayer, ſaying, <hi>I am not like long to be with you; the Lord pardon us, and heal us, and make us more Heavenly, and take us off from the world, and make us burning and ſhining Lights, by our heavenly Doctrine and Example. And I beſeech the Lord with all my heart to bleſs you, and to bleſs his Churches, and to bleſs all his People, and to bleſs all your Families, and to bleſs your Wives, and to bleſs all your Children, and your Childrens Children; and make us all more and more meet for our Inheritance, and bring us all to it in his good time,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe words, with ſome few other, he ſpake with great affection, and with tears: and all the Miniſters wept with him, and they took their leave of him, even as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their Father, who having bleſſed them was about to die.</p>

               <p>THis Year it pleaſed God to viſit <hi>New-England</hi> with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his diſpleaſure, by the death of three Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Inſtruments: The firſt whereof was that worthy Servant of Chriſt Mr. <hi>Samuel Shepard,</hi> Paſtor of the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Rowley</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> who deceaſed in the Spring of this year, in the midſt of his dayes, and in the beginning of his Work in the Miniſtry. The ſecond, that worthy Man of God Mr. <hi>Henry Flint,</hi> Teacher of the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Braintry</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> who ended his mortal life the 27 of <hi>April</hi> in this year; a man of known Piety, Gravity, and Integrity, and well accompliſhed with other Qualifications fit for the Work of the Miniſtry. The third and laſt, but not the leaſt, that Super-eminent Miniſter of the Goſpel (rightly ſo called) Mr. <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Mitchel,</hi> Paſtor of the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> who laid down his Earthly Tabernacle on the Ninth of <hi>July</hi> in this year: Of whoſe rare Endowments, and the great Loſs the whole Land ſuſtained by his death, take this following brief Account.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jonathan Mitchell</hi> was born at <hi>Halifax</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> of pious and wealthy Parents, who coming over
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:96779:101"/>
to <hi>New-England,</hi> brought him over young; his Education in Learning was perfected at <hi>Harvard</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he attained to ſuch a degree in knowledge, that he was ſoon called to be a Fellow of the Colledge, and within few years after his luſtre did ſo ſhine, that the Church at <hi>Hartford</hi> upon <hi>Conecticot</hi> River made application to him in order to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of that Eminent Servant of Chriſt Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> a little before deceaſed; but the Church at <hi>Cambridge</hi> (by the Advice of their Paſtor Mr. <hi>Thomas Shepard,</hi> then living) not willing to part with ſo great a Treaſure, became Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor with <hi>Hartford,</hi> and gave him a Call to them. This loving Strife between the two Churches of <hi>Hartford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> about him, was in a ſhort time decided by the awfull hand of God, in the death of that Eminent and Glorious Star, Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Shepard,</hi> Paſtor at <hi>Cambridge;</hi> which place being wholly deſtitute, and <hi>Hartford</hi> being ſupplied with a Teacher, namely, that Worthy of the Lord, Mr. <hi>Samuel Stone,</hi> the Ballance was caſt for <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and in the year 1650 he was Called and Ordained their Paſtor. It was an eminent favour of God to that Church, to have their great Breach thus made up, with a man ſo much of the Spirit and Principles of their former Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, and ſo excellently qualified with reſpect to the Colledge: for, Reaſon and Prudence requireth, that the Miniſter of that place be more then ordinarily endowed with Learning, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Wiſdome, Orthodoxneſs, Ability, ſweet and excellent Gifts in Preaching, that ſo the Scholars which are devoted and ſet apart in order to be Preachers of the Goſpel, might be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with the Spirit of ſuch an <hi>Elijah:</hi> In which regard, this holy Man of God was eminently furniſhed, and his Labours wonderfully bleſſed; for very many of the Scholars bred up in his time (as is obſerved) do favour of his Spirit, for grace and manner of Preaching, which was moſt attractive. He lived Paſtor of the Church about Eighteen years, and was moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe and faithful in declaring much of the Counſel of God. He went through a great part of the Body of Divinity; made a very excellent <hi>Expoſition</hi> of the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and part of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96779:102"/>
                  <hi>Exodus;</hi> and delivered many fruitful and profitable Sermons on the four firſt Chapters of <hi>John;</hi> and in his <hi>Monethly Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</hi> which were abundantly frequented, he Preached <hi>of Mans Miſery by Sin,</hi> and <hi>Recovery by Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and died in the third part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning <hi>Mans Obedience in Chriſt:</hi> beſides many other excellent Truths by him taught upon divers occaſions. In all his Labours God was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſent with him. He was a perſon that held very near Communion with God, Eminent in Wiſdome, Piety, Humility, Love, Self-denial, and of a compaſſionate and tender heart; ſurpaſſing in Publick-ſpiritedneſs; a mighty man in Prayer, and Eminent at ſtanding in the Gap; he was zealous for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and faithful in aſſerting the Truth againſt all Oppugners of it. In a word, he was a man whom God had richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and eminently fitted for his Work; lived deſired, and died lamented by all good Chriſtians that knew him. It pleaſed God upon the Ninth of <hi>July,</hi> 1668. in a hot and burning ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, (but much more hot in the Heat of Gods Anger to <hi>New-England</hi>) to take him to Reſt and Glory, about the 43 year of his Age. His Race was but ſhort, but the Work he did was very much. The <hi>Elegies</hi> following may give the Reader a further account of what eſteem he was.</p>

               <p>A fourth Miniſter that died this year, was Mr. <hi>John Eliot</hi> Junior, born at <hi>Roxbury</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> Eldeſt Son of the Reverend Mr. <hi>John Eliot,</hi> Teacher of the Church there. He was Educated (at <hi>Cambridge</hi>) in the Latine School, and in the Colledge, untill he became <hi>Maſter of Arts;</hi> and a few years after was called to be Paſtor of a Church within the Bounds of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> upon the South-ſide of <hi>Charles River.</hi> He was a perſon excellently endowed, and accompliſhed with Gifts of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:96779:104"/>
                  <hi>Nature, Learning,</hi> and <hi>Grace;</hi> of comely Proportion, ruddy Complexion, chearful Countenance; of quick Apprehenſion, ſolid Judgement, excellent Prudence; Learned both in <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Arts</hi> for one of his time, and ſtudiouſly intenſe in acquiring more knowledge. His Abilities and Acceptation in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry did excell; His Piety, Faith, Love, Humility, Self-deniall, and Zeal, did eminently ſhine upon all occaſions. He had (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of his Father) by his diligence, induſtry, and zeal (for the good of Souls) attained to ſuch skill in the <hi>Indian</hi> Language, that he Preached to the <hi>Indians</hi> ſundry years; Travelling many miles in a day once a Fortnight to diſpenſe the Goſpel to them. The <hi>Indians</hi> have often ſaid, that <hi>his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them was precious and deſireable;</hi> and conſequently their loſs, and the obſtruction in that Work, much to be lamented. In a word, there was ſo much of God in him, that all the wiſe and godly who knew him, loved and honoured him in the Lord, and bewailed his death; which ſell upon the 13 day of <hi>October</hi> 1668. and of his Age about 35 years.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Shall cloſe up this ſmall</hi> Hiſtory <hi>with a word of Advice to the</hi> Riſing-generation, <hi>That as now their godly Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors have had large Experience of the goodneſs and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, for the ſpace of near Fourty ſix years (ſome of them) and have paſſed under various Diſpenſations, ſometimes under great</hi> Afflictions, <hi>other-while</hi> the Sun ſhining upon their Tabernacles <hi>in wayes of</hi> peace <hi>and</hi> proſperity, <hi>and yet notwithſtanding, through the grace of Chriſt, the moſt of them have held their integrity in his Wayes: That ſo, ſuch as ſucceed them would follow their Examples, ſo farre as they have followed Chriſt; that it might not be ſaid of them, as it is to be feared it may be, by what yet appears amongst many of them, That indeed</hi> God did once plant a Noble vine in <hi>New-England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jerem. 2 21.</note> but it is degenerated into the plant of a ſtrange vine. <hi>It were well
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96779:105"/>
that it might be ſaid, that the</hi> Riſing-generation did ſerve the Lord all the dayes of <hi>ſuch as in this our</hi> Iſrael <hi>are as</hi> Joſhua's <hi>amongst us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſh. 24.31.</note> and the Elders that over lived him, which have known all the works of the Lord which he hath done for their Fathers. <hi>But if yet notwithſtanding afterwards ſuch ſhall forget, and not regard thoſe his</hi> great Works <hi>here preſented before them (beſides many more that I hope by ſome others may come to their view) be they aſſured,</hi> He will deſtroy them, and not build them up.<note place="margin">Pſal. 28.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let the truely godly in this Land be incited by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of</hi> Moſes, <hi>as the mouth of the Church, to pray earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inceſſantly unto the Lord,</hi> That his work may yet appear to his ſervants,<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.16.
